	abstract = {The human hand's exceptional dexterity and compliance, derived from its rigid-soft coupling structure and tendon-driven interphalangeal coordination, inspire robotic grippers capable of versatile grasping and force adaptation. Traditional rigid manipulators lack compliance for delicate tasks, while soft robots often suffer from instability and low load capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose a biomimetic multi-joint composite finger integrating a 3D-printed rigid phalanges (46-51 mm) with dual fabric-reinforced pneumatic bladders, mimicking human finger biomechanics. This hybrid design combines hinge-jointed rigidity and anisotropic fabric constraints, enabling two rotational degrees of freedom with higher radial stiffness, achieving 2.18× higher critical burst pressure (240 kPa) than non-reinforced bladders, while preserving axial compliance. Experimental validation demonstrates a 4.77 N maximum fingertip force at 200 kPa and rapid recovery (< 2s) post-impact. The composite finger exhibits human-like gestures (enveloping, pinching, flipping) and adapts to irregular/fragile objects (e.g., eggs, screws) through coordinated bladder actuation. Assembled into a modular gripper, it sustains 1 kg payloads and executes thin-object flipping via proximal-distal joint synergy. This rigid-soft coupling design bridges compliance and robustness, offering high environmental adaptability for applications in industrial automation, human-robot interaction, and delicate manipulation. © The Author(s), 2025.

These tasks place higher demands on the force control performance of robots, particularly in scenarios where the environment is unknown, making constant force control challenging. This study first analyzes the robot and its interaction model with the environment, highlighting the limitations of traditional force control methods in addressing unknown environmental stiffness. Based on this analysis, a variable admittance control strategy is proposed using the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, enabling the online tuning of admittance parameters through reinforcement learning. Furthermore, this strategy is integrated with a quaternion-based nonlinear model predictive control scheme, ensuring coordination between pose tracking and constant-force control and enhancing overall control performances. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves constant force control accuracy and task execution stability, validating the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Bioinspired active pillar structures, known for their large surface area, mechanical compliance, and diverse deformation modes, have garnered extensive research interest. Among various active pillar structures, liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) pillar arrays are capable of exhibiting significant and reversible anisotropic deformation under cyclic heating and cooling, showing great potential in tunable adhesion, soft robots, and biomedical devices. However, scaling up LCE pillar manufacturing remains challenging, limiting its practical applications. In this work, a solvent-free LCE resin is developed with unique features including simple operating procedure, short fabrication time, and tunable responsive temperature, enabling rapid and large-scale production of LCE pillar arrays. The LCE resin allows for the preparation of complex 3D shapes in addition to film or specimen. The fabrication time can be as short as 4 h, without the need to evaporate solvent. Moreover, the LCE resins can be adjusted with a variable phase transition temperature range from 49.4 °C to 97.7 °C by incorporating non-liquid crystal acrylate chains. The resulting active pillar array structure can undertake sequential actuation upon heating with the tunable actuation temperature. Finally, the application of these pillar arrays in multi-level information encryption is demonstrated. The LCE pillar structure introduced here offers a new strategy for constructing advanced active LCE structures with tunable responsive behavior. © Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences 2025.},

	abstract = {Admittance control is a widely used approach for ensuring compliant robot behavior in physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) tasks. The selection of admittance parameters is crucial, as it directly affects interaction stability. However, this process becomes challenging when the robot's interaction with objects involves not only the human hand but also the task environment. This is because the task environment is often unknown and hard to predict while the models of the human hand have been extensively studied in previous work. To address this issue, this paper proposes an admittance adaptive algorithm that ensures stability in human–robot-environment interaction tasks. This algorithm can adjust damping online without prior information about environments. Specifically, we consider the coupling between the robot, human hand, and task environment, treating them as a whole to analyze interaction stability and construct an energy function. Then, based on the energy function, a passive observer is designed to monitor unstable behaviors during the interaction process. Finally, the algorithm adjusts the damping online based on the observed values. The algorithm was experimentally validated using a custom admittance force feedback device. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm can ensure interaction stability without prior information about environments. In the experiment of writing letters, compared to a constant-parameter admittance controller, the algorithm reduces operator effort while maintaining stability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {By dynamic planning, we refer to the ability of the human brain to infer and impose motor trajectories related to cognitive decisions. A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference – either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control – inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents. We start from a simple unit and gradually describe more advanced structures, comparing recently proposed design choices and providing basic examples. This study distances itself from traditional views centered on neural networks and reinforcement learning, and points toward a yet unexplored direction in active inference: hybrid representations in hierarchical models. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The current study investigated possible human-robot kinaesthetic interactions using a variational recurrent neural network (RNN) model, called PV-RNN, which is based on the free-energy principle. Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between the top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy. The current study examines how changing the meta-prior w in the interaction phase affects the counter force generated when an experimenter attempts to induce movement pattern transitions familiar to the robot through its prior training. The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Finally, the study examines how different levels of disturbances, pattern level, and cognitive level can be resolved internally across different layers. Our experimental results indicated that 1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when w is set with larger/smaller values; 2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions; and 3) when the robot was disturbed in the cognitive level, the disturbance was resolved more in the higher layer as compared to the case with disturbance in the pattern level. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in action intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them. © 2013 IEEE.},

For indirect intent, it draws inspiration from the speed–curvature–torsion pattern reflecting human motion laws in 3-D space. An expected force model is constructed to characterize the long-term motion objectives of indirect intent. Based on a directional admittance guidance mechanism, the estimated indirect intent enables the robot to collaborate with the operator and provide motion guidance.

An anisotropic admittance model ensures compliant motion in the cutting direction while enforcing geometric constraints in normal and depth directions. The control scheme was implemented on a UR5e manipulator and validated through three experimental trials on identical anatomical mandible models. Postoperative CT scans were registered to preoperative plans, and cutting accuracy was evaluated using 13 anatomical landmarks per model.

	abstract = {Sensing the deformation of soft robots is vital for effective control and interaction with the environment. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables such sensing by monitoring changes in conductivity, but its sensitivity is often highest near the electrodes, limiting performance for distant deformations. Existing strategies to address this limitation typically rely on introducing conductive material heterogeneities, such as anisotropic or patterned conductors, to redirect current flow. In this work, a fundamentally different approach is presented: utilizing a dielectric guide to manipulate the electric field within the conductive body. This method leverages widely used soft robotic materials, such as silicone, in a new role as a passive electric field guide, allowing reconfiguration of sensitivity distributions without embedding conductive components. Physical experiments with a conductive hydrogel cylinder show that the dielectric guide increases deformation sensing accuracy by 21%, reduces sensitivity to noise, and enables a reduction in the number of required EIT channels.

Motivated by the concept of mechanical intelligence [1], where controls for obstacle navigation can be offloaded to passive body mechanics in terrestrial limbless locomotion, we hypothesize that principles of mechanical intelligence can be extended to cluttered hydrodynamic regimes. To test this, we developed an untethered limbless robot capable of undulatory swimming on water surfaces, utilizing a bilateral cable-driven mechanism inspired by organismal muscle actuation morphology to achieve programmable anisotropic body compliance. We demonstrated through robophysical experiments that, similar to terrestrial locomotion, an appropriate level of body compliance can facilitate emergent swim through complex hydrodynamic environments under pure open-loop control. Moreover, we found that swimming performance depends on undulation frequency, with effective locomotion achieved only within a specific frequency range. This contrasts with highly damped terrestrial regimes, where inertial effects can often be neglected. Further, to enhance performance and address the challenges posed by nondeterministic obstacle distributions, we incorporated computational intelligence by developing a real-time body compliance tuning controller based on cable tension feedback. This controller improves the robot's robustness and overall speed in heterogeneous hydrodynamic environments. © 2025 IEEE.},

The robot adopts an inchworm-like peristaltic motion for its bellow-structured body, and it utilizes a self-locking mechanism, realized by exploiting the anisotropic interaction of its reconfigurable fins with the pipe ridges, to achieve the desired locomotion. A feature of the design is that the robot robustly moves by an integral multiple of the ridge-to-ridge distance per actuation cycle, allowing the robot to self-localize within the pipe. Experiments are conducted to characterize the stress-strain relationship of the 3D-printed compliant material (thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)). The results are used in finite element analysis (FEA)-based design of the bellows structure and the fins for achieving the desired compliance and stiffness anisotropy, respectively. Experiments on a robot prototype inside a four-inch drainage pipe have confirmed the utility of the FEA-based design in achieving sound anisotropic fin stiffness, and the robot's capability to travel a fixed number of ridge-to-ridge distances per actuation cycle, determined by the contraction/expansion stroke.

	abstract = {Wearable robots, especially those composed of soft materials, are increasingly attracting interest due to their comfort, ease of donning and doffing, and their ability to provide assistance across various applications. In wearable robotics, striking a balance between ensuring low impedance for wearer comfort and providing sufficient assistive force is a notable design challenge. In this study, we propose exploiting impedance variation in accordance with the types of muscle contraction in the human body. Particularly in eccentric muscle contraction, the impedance can help reduce the muscular load, since it exerts force in the same direction as the muscles. To utilize the relation, we proposed a linked-layer jamming mechanism, which adjusts its impedance largely in various directions. This mechanism allows not only a broad variable range of impedance in multiple rotation directions but also directional torque design, even when equipped in human multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joints. By constructing a wearable robot prototype equipped with the proposed linked-layer jamming mechanisms, the effectiveness of this impedance-based assistance approach was confirmed through experiments. The findings from this study present new possibilities in wearable robot design, showing that suitably amplified impedance can assist human motion, potentially enhancing task efficiency and lowering injury risk. This work thus offers a new perspective for researchers in the field of wearable robots, demonstrating that impedance, often minimized in existing designs, can be utilized beneficially when properly amplified. © The Author(s) 2024.

	abstract = {Object handover is a fundamental task for collaborative robots, particularly service robots. In in-home assistance scenarios, individuals often face constraints due to their posture and declining physical functions, necessitating high demands on robots for flexible real-time control and intuitive interactions. During robot-to-human handovers, individuals are limited to making perceptual judgements based on the appearance of the object and the consistent behaviour of the robot. This hinders their comprehensive perception and may lead to unexpected dangerous behaviour. Various handover trajectories pose challenges to predictive robot control and motion coordination. Many studies have shown that force guidance can provide adequate information to the receivers. However, force modulation with intention judgements based on velocity, acceleration, or jerk may impede the intended motion and require additional effort. In this paper, starting from a human-to-human handover study, an anisotropic variable force-guided robot-to-human handover control method is proposed to overcome the cognition-reality gap. The retraction motion was decoupled based on a fitted motion plane and a task-related linear trajectory, which served as a reference for overshoot suppression and impedance force modulation. The experimental results and user surveys show that the anisotropic variable impedance force suppresses overshooting without impeding the intended motions, giving the receiver sufficient time for behavioural adjustments and assisting them in completing a safe and efficient handover in a preferred manner. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper presents a mobile supernumerary robotic approach to physical assistance in human–robot conjoined actions. The study starts with the description of the SUPER-MAN concept. The idea is to develop and utilize mobile collaborative systems that can follow human loco-manipulation commands to perform industrial tasks through three main components: (i) an admittance-type interface, (ii) a human–robot interaction controller and (iii) a supernumerary robotic body. Next, we present two possible implementations within the framework — from theoretical and hardware perspectives. The first system is called MOCA-MAN, and is composed of a redundant torque-controlled robotic arm and an omni-directional mobile platform. The second one is called Kairos-MAN, formed by a high-payload 6-DoF velocity-controlled robotic arm and an omni-directional mobile platform. The systems share the same admittance interface, through which user wrenches are translated to loco-manipulation commands, generated by whole-body controllers of each system. Besides, a thorough user-study with multiple and cross-gender subjects is presented to reveal the quantitative performance of the two systems in effort demanding and dexterous tasks. Moreover, we provide qualitative results from the NASA-TLX questionnaire to demonstrate the SUPER-MAN approach's potential and its acceptability from the users’ viewpoint. © 2024},

In this study, we proposed a novel variable admittance model designed for robotic mobile platforms. The proposed admittance model achieves the decoupling of the desired dynamics related to the intended motion direction from that of the unintentional motion, ensuring that changes in one space do not affect the other. In the unintentional space, the admittance parameters remain constant, while the inertia and damping gains along the intended motion direction are adjusted to provide compliance to the human user. The design of these variable terms was performed to ensure a consistent response, aiming to offer a perceived consistent behavior to the human user and to guarantee strict passivity under human force input, ensuring manipulation stability. In addition to theoretical proof of passivity, we validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed control scheme through experimental results using an omni-directional robotic mobile platform. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this study, an adaptive object deformability-agnostic human-robot collaborative transportation framework is presented. The proposed framework enables to combine the haptic information transferred through the object with the human kinematic information obtained from a motion capture system to generate reactive whole-body motions on a mobile collaborative robot. Furthermore, it allows rotating the objects in an intuitive and accurate way during co-transportation based on an algorithm that detects the human rotation intention using the torso and hand movements. First, we validate the framework with the two extremities of the object deformability range (i.e., purely rigid aluminum rod and highly deformable rope) by utilizing a mobile manipulator which consists of an Omni-directional mobile base and a collaborative robotic arm. Next, its performance is compared with an admittance controller during a co-carry task of a partially deformable object in a 12-subjects user study. Quantitative and qualitative results of this experiment show that the proposed framework can effectively handle the transportation of objects regardless of their deformability and provides intuitive assistance to human partners. Finally, we have demonstrated the potential of our framework in a different scenario, where the human and the robot co-transport a manikin using a deformable sheet. Note to Practitioners - Transportation of objects which requires the cooperation of multiple partners, is a common task in industrial settings such as factories and warehouses. The existing human-robot collaboration solutions for this task have focused only on purely rigid objects, although deformable objects need to be carried frequently in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a human-robot collaborative transportation framework that can handle objects with different deformability ranging from purely rigid to highly deformable. In particular, the proposed framework generates whole-body movements on a mobile collaborative robot by combining of the haptic information transmitted through the object and the human motion information obtained from a motion capture system. Moreover, the framework includes an intuitive way to rotate the object during the execution based on human hand and torso motion. The results of the experiments where objects with various deformability characteristics were transported in collaboration with a mobile manipulator demonstrated the high potential of the proposed approach in a laboratory setting. In the future, we plan to employ a less expensive vision-based human motion tracking system instead of the IMU-based system used in this study. With this change, we will be able to eliminate the need for wearable sensors from the framework presented, which would enhance its usability in real-world scenarios. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {At present, the serious challenge of human-robot collaboration is how to establish an interaction interface with multi-directional interactivity and robustness. This paper applies surface electromyography (sEMG) signals as the interface medium, and proposes a robust 3D arm strength estimation model based on hybrid deep learning networks (R3DNet) to build a stable interaction interface and achieve reliable human-robot collaboration performance in 3D operation scenarios. R3DNet adopts the modular design idea and includes a feature extraction module, a regression estimation module, and a robust enhancement module. In the feature extraction module, an autoencoder structure-based network and a new loss function are proposed to extract the fusion features of multi-channel sEMG signals. In the regression estimation module, an arm strength model based on transfer learning algorithms is proposed. This model considers the similarity of arm strength estimation in each direction and realizes the arm strength estimation from one to three dimensions through the fine-tune strategy. The robust enhancement module adopts a residual structure and aims to address the problem of poor model robustness due to non-ideal conditions such as electrode displacement, muscle fatigue, muscle time-varying characteristics and differences in muscle characteristics among subjects. Further, an improved adaptive admittance control method is proposed to help the robot to adjust collaborative behavior according to the changing arm strength of the human tutor. The results of comparison experiments and multi-point flexible assembly experiments verify the validity and engineering realizability of R3DNet for human-robot collaboration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Robotic manipulation holds the potential to replace humans in the execution of tedious or dangerous tasks. However, control-based approaches are not suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Therefore, applying manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a novel framework for skill learning in robotic manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (TactileAIRL), aimed at achieving efficient learning. To enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference, which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we have designed universal tactile static and dynamic features based on vision-based tactile sensors, making our framework scalable to many manipulation tasks learning involving tactile feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly high training efficiency in objects pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks with just few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline. Furthermore, we conduct physical experiments on a gripper screwing task using our method, which showcases the algorithm's rapid learning capability and its potential for practical applications. © 2024 IEEE.},

Clinical rigidity can be quantitatively assessed by the estimation of the static passive component of the joint impedance, known as passive stiffness. Here we propose an experimental setup and a methodology for estimating the passive stiffness of the human wrist across two coupled Degrees of Freedom (DoFs): Flexo-Extension (FE) and Radio-Ulnar Deviation (RUD). A robotic arm passively moved the participant's wrist, whose movements and interaction forces/torques were recorded through infrared cameras and a 6-axis load cell, respectively. Conversely to most previous studies, that approximated wrist angular displacements and torques with the robot joint angles and torques, we considered a wrist kinematic model with two orthogonal axes (FE and RUD) intersecting at the wrist center of rotation. We tested our method on four healthy volunteers and employed multiple linear regression to estimate 2-by-2 stiffness matrix and represent its symmetric component in the form of a stiffness ellipse. The results were comparable with the prior literature. Specifically, the joint stiffness in the FE-RUD space was confirmed to be anisotropic, with the stiffness along RUD higher than along FE, and with the axis of maximum stiffness tilted counterclockwise of a few degrees with respect to the pure RUD axis. © 2024 IEEE.},

In this study, the relationship between the conductivity distribution of the material used as a detector and the sensing performance including sensitivity, force range, spatial resolution, and position accuracy is clarified to develop high-performance tomographic tactile sensors for specific purposes. The performance maps reveal that a material with a conductivity of approximately 0.2 S/m can serve as an effective detector for touch interactions involving a force range of several Newtons. Additionally, incorporating gradient conductivity in the cross section of the detector and multilayer conductive porous media with anisotropic conductive bonding can help expand the design flexibility for enhanced performance.

Active compliance suction units, which consist of twofold innovation, are proposed for this robot to overcome the bottleneck involving adsorption on the variable curvature surface. To solve the dilemma between high vacuum tolerance and surface compliance capability, we designed a novel trachea-inspired anisotropic stiffness sealing lip for the suction chamber, and it showed flexibility in the adsorption direction for adoption to complex surfaces and presented a high stiffness that can withstand large vacuum forces at its sides. Furthermore, to avoid vacuum leaks due to overstretching and overcompressing of the sealing lip, we developed an active compliance actuator to align the axis direction of the suction chamber with the normal direction of the adsorbed surface and maintain a suitable distance. To meeting strict weight and dimension demands, the actuator innovatively combines cable-driven units and 3-revolute-revolute-spherical parallel mechanism to reach a high load/weight ratio. The prototype of the climbing machining robot was developed and tested on a real large wind-turbine blade with variable curvatures ranging from 1 to 15 m. The experimental results show that the 10 kg-weight climbing machining robot with three ACSUs can provide over 1000 N adsorption force in total, and the fluctuation of adsorption forces can be reduced by 96% compared with that of robots with traditional pure passive compliance suction units. A comparative polishing experiment was executed on different curvature regions of the wind turbine blade, and the results prove that the proposed method can apply uniform polishing. In addition, a polishing-quality verification experiment was realized using the proposed climbing machining robot with a force-controlled polisher. These polishing experiments proved the machining capability of the proposed climbing robot. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

However, the same compliance hinders the generation of propelling forces, and current approaches face a tradeoff between traveling speed, action range, and control complexity. We overcome this trade-off by developing a locomotion mechanism based on the synergistic interaction between symmetric vibrations, elasticity, and asymmetric morphology. We then realize a rapid soft locomotor using inexpensive off-the-shelf components and requiring only elementary actuation and control. A single robotic unit can travel at speeds up to 100 mm/s when tethered and 35 mm/s when untethered. We derive a model that predicts the speed of the robot as a function of several design parameters and physical properties, highlighting the role of geometric asymmetries in the resulting anisotropic motion. Moreover, these elementary units can be added together to create more complex behaviors. By adding 2 units in parallel, the assembly can locomote and be steered following nonholonomic constraints. Our approach opens the door to a new class of low-cost soft robots that can travel fast and far with elementary fabrication and control, and which can be combined to achieve complex functions without compromising their essential simplicity. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

In this article, we developed a simple three-dimensional printable micro/macro dual driving multipede millirobot to successfully satisfy both high precision and high velocity, by employing bio-inspired titled legs through the concept of anisotropic friction. Four locomotory modes (stick, stick-slip, pure-slip, and jumping) of the millirobot were carefully examined and effectively manipulated to switch micro and macro motions for high precision and high velocity, respectively. We investigated the effects of external conditions (mobile surface roughness and excitation waveform) and internal conditions (geometric parameters of driving legs) on the locomotory modes. The millirobot achieved a step resolution of 2 μm in the micromotion and maximum mobile velocity of 800 mm/s in the macromotion. In addition, our millirobot can perform bi-directional motion (forward and backward) with quick return characteristics. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Soft robots can adapt to dynamic environments without prior knowledge of their properties. Plants inspire mechanisms for counterbalancing dynamic loads by locally modulating compliance through anisotropic humidity-responsive materials and structures. In addition to well-known passive bilayers, plants may also actively control swelling. The combination of robust hygroscopic material-level response and simple electrical control makes active swelling particularly attractive for technological implementation. However, dynamic swelling demands the development and optimisation of congruent pumping solutions. This work suggests electrohydrodynamic pumping, enabled by highly reversible ion immobilisation at capacitive electrodes, as a particularly suitable low-pressure, high-area liquid displacement solution for active swelling. Local pore fill ratio (PFR) modulation is used as a measure for dynamic liquid displacement and swelling. A method for highly localised (10 μm membrane thickness) assessment of the dynamic variation of PFR in a 400 μm laminate undergoing cross-plane electrokinetic liquid displacement is developed. Two modes for transient PFR modulation were identified: electrokinetic ion transfer and diffusive solvent redistribution, pronounced at high and low voltage scan rates, respectively. The strategic combination of these modes enables various compliance-modulation scenarios. The system contains (within a cycle) a constant amount of liquid in an open network of liquid-filled pores. 30%-75% PFR yielded the highest dynamic PFR modulation: a high amount of empty pores is beneficial, yet a too-low PFR compromises the continuous liquid pathway necessary for electrokinetic pumping. The dynamic nature of internal liquid rearrangement was characterised by relatively fast electrokinetics-driven fluxes (6.3% PFR change in 80 s), followed by a slow equilibration of concentration and PFR. At high scan rates, PFR decreased at positive polarisation, while both positive and negative polarity yielded a similar decrease at low scan rates (5 mV s<sup>−1</sup>). Localised control over the swelling gradient enables the design of systems that morphologically adapt to complex dynamic loading conditions. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We proposed a tubular soft robot with a simple structure of a spring-rolled dielectric elastomer (SRDE) and compliant passive bristles. Due to the compliance of the bristles, the proposed robots can work in pipelines with inner diameters both larger and smaller than the one of the bristles. Firstly, the nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the SRDE were investigated experimentally. Then, we fabricated the proposed robot with a bristle diameter of 19 mm and then studied its performance in pipelines on the ground with inner diameters of 18 mm and 20 mm. When the pipeline’s inner diameter was less than the outer diameter of the bristles, the bristles remained in the state of bending and the robot locomotion is mainly due to anisotropic friction (1.88 and 0.88 body lengths per second horizontally and vertically, respectively, in inner diameter of 18 mm and 0.06 body length per second in that of 16 mm). In the case of the pipeline with the larger inner diameter, the bristles were not fully constrained, and a small bending moment applied on the lower bristle legs contributed to the robot’s locomotion, leading to a high velocity (2.78 body lengths per second in 20 mm diameter acrylic pipe). In addition, the robot can work in varying geometries, such as curving pipes (curve radius ranges from 0.11 m to 0.31 m) at around two body lengths per second horizontally and on the ground at 3.52 body lengths per second, showing promise for pipeline or narrow space inspections. © 2023 by the authors.},

This work was motivated by the benefits provided by passively and directionally compliant legs in humans and animals. UPed uses under-actuated legs based on the bent-knee model which is capable of changing the direction and magnitude of the leg compliance by adjusting the knee angle and distal leg stiffness. Pneumatic pistons were chosen as variable compliance elements, enabling the leg compliance to be adjusted during locomotion. The platform was validated experimentally by evaluating how the robot's pitch rate and cost of transport changed with variations in leg compliance and knee angle. Results of these experiments indicated that significant performance improvements are possible by selecting appropriate values of compliance and knee angle. They also demonstrated a unique capability to explore adjustable directional compliance and other parameters in robot legs on a physical robotic system. UPed has the potential to facilitate significant performance improvements of legged robots by enabling additional in-depth studies on directional passive leg compliance. © 2022 by ASME.},

Soft crawling robots may be widely applied to travel across complex environment, such as post-disaster search and rescue, environmental exploration, medical surgery, and so on. Soft crawling robots can move forward through elongating and contracting their bodies, but the smooth body surfaces like silicone material have limited their speed of movement. In nature, soft animals use their scales or setae to increase friction anisotropy and propel their bodies forward. Using biologically-inspired skin is an recognized way to increase the movement speed of soft crawling robots effectively. The directionality of the snake scales can produce anisotropic friction with the ground when moving forward, which is necessary to promote the movement of the snake. Inspired by snake scales, we developed a hard scale structure that can be fixed to the bottom of the pneumatic actuators. These scales can generate friction force when in contact with the substrate surface, which increases the speed of this soft crawling robot. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The safety-critical nature of vehicle steering is one of the main motivations for exploring the space of possible cyber-physical attacks against the steering systems of modern vehicles. This paper investigates the adversarial capabilities for destabilizing the interaction dynamics between human drivers and vehicle haptic shared control (HSC) steering systems. In contrast to the conventional robotics literature, where the main objective is to render the human-automation interaction dynamics stable by ensuring passivity, this paper takes the exact opposite route. In particular, to investigate the damaging capabilities of a successful cyber-physical attack, this paper demonstrates that an attacker who targets the HSC steering system can destabilize the interaction dynamics between the human driver and the vehicle HSC steering system through synthesis of time-varying impedance profiles. Specifically, it is shown that the adversary can utilize a properly designed non-passive and time-varying adversarial impedance target dynamics, which are fed with a linear combination of the human driver and the steering column torques. Using these target dynamics, it is possible for the adversary to generate in realtime a reference angular command for the driver input device and the directional control steering assembly of the vehicle. Furthermore, it is shown that the adversary can make the steering wheel and the vehicle steering column angular positions to follow the reference command generated by the time-varying impedance target dynamics using proper adaptive control strategies. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of such time-varying impedance attacks, which result in a non-passive and inherently unstable interaction between the driver and the HSC steering system. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The compliant nature of vine robots, or everted tubes, makes them very useful for passively navigating sensitive and cluttered environments. Like many soft robots, their compliance makes kinematic modeling difficult. This work seeks to validate the assumption that everted tubes can be modeled as an inflated cantilever beam. The tip deflection and curvature of tubes constructed from Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) and commercially available silicone coated nylon, two commonly used materials for everted tube robots, were measured under several different loading conditions in both everted and non-everted configurations. Our data show that everted tubes constructed from LDPE can be modeled with Comer's model for inflated isotropic beams, which has been assumed in recent literature. In contrast, this model did not fit the silicone coated nylon beams' behavior. This is because of the anisotropic properties of fabric the current model does not consider. Results also showed that everted tubes collapsed before the modeled maximum loading condition at a constant tip displacement, whereas uneverted tubes collapsed slightly after the modeled maximum load. From the inflated beam model, we present an iterative approach to computing the forward kinematics of an everted tube in contact with an obstacle within an environment. This allows for estimating contact forces and determining the static pose of an everted tube. © 2023 IEEE.},

Our approach allows the full control of the co-carrying trajectories by the person while sharing the load with multiple robots depending on the size and the weight of the object. This is achieved by merging the haptic information transferred through the object and the human motion information obtained from a motion capture system. One important advantage of the framework is that no strict internal communication is required between the robots, regardless of the object size and deformation characteristics. We validate the framework with two challenging real-world scenarios: co-transportation of a wooden rigid closet and a bulky box on top of forklift moving straps, with the latter characterizing deformable objects. In order to evaluate the generalizability of the proposed framework, a heterogenous team of two mobile manipulators that consist of an Omni-directional mobile base and a collaborative robotic arm with different DoFs is chosen for the experiments. The qualitative comparison between our controller and the baseline controller (i.e., an admittance controller) during these experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework especially when co-carrying deformable objects. Furthermore, we believe that the performance of our framework during the experiment with the lifting straps offers a promising solution for the co-transportation of bulky and ungraspable objects. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Concepts that draw inspiration from soft biological tissues have enabled significant advances in creating artificial materials for a range of applications, such as dry adhesives, tissue engineering, biointegrated electronics, artificial muscles, and soft robots. Many biological tissues, represented by muscles, exhibit directionally dependent mechanical and electrical properties. However, equipping synthetic materials with tissue-like mechanical and electrical anisotropies remains challenging. Here, we present the bioinspired concepts, design principles, numerical modeling, and experimental demonstrations of soft elastomer composites with programmed mechanical and electrical anisotropies, as well as their integrations with active functionalities. Mechanically assembled, 3D structures of polyimide serve as skeletons to offer anisotropic, nonlinear mechanical properties, and crumpled conductive surfaces provide anisotropic electrical properties, which can be used to construct bioelectronic devices. Finite element analyses quantitatively capture the key aspects that govern mechanical anisotropies of elastomer composites, providing a powerful design tool. Incorporation of 3D skeletons of thermally responsive polycaprolactone into elastomer composites allows development of an active artificial material that can mimic adaptive mechanical behaviors of skeleton muscles at relaxation and contraction states. Furthermore, the fabrication process of anisotropic elastomer composites is compatible with dielectric elastomer actuators, indicating potential applications in humanoid artificial muscles and soft robots. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Soft robots made from soft materials show great advantages over rigid robots in environmental adaptability and motion flexibility. However, too soft body makes them lose the load capacity, which limits their applications in locomotion. Although the crawling tensegrity robots with both rigid bars and flexible cables are potential to address this challenge, the existing inchworm friction drive methods are difficult to realize the motion of a single tensegrity unit. Besides, the lack of appropriate soft actuators and robot configuration also blocks the development of the crawling tensegrity robots. This article presents a new inchworm driving method realized by the inclined supporting feet. By using the twisted artificial muscle (TAM) as actuator, the combination of the TAM and the inclined supporting feet endows a single three-bar tensegrity unit with multimotion capacity and anisotropic stiffness characteristics. The designed tensegrity robot not only has high compliance but also displays high stiffness, which endows it with high load capacity. The prototype can carry a load of 150 g (7.5 times of its weight) to achieve straight and turning motions. This article provides a design idea for the crawling tensegrity robot and a theoretical foundation for improving the load capacity of high compliance robots. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

The vehicle position is optimized by utilizing constrained particle swarm optimization where the objective is to enhance directional manipulability of the robotic arm within the system. A forward dynamic controller is implemented to eliminate undesired excessive motions near singular joint configurations. A reset control algorithm along with an admittance type controller are developed for stable interaction with an unknown object under environmental disturbances.

In order to validate our framework experimentally, we compared its performance with an admittance controller during a co-transportation task of a partially deformable object. We additionally demonstrate the potential of the framework while co-transporting rigid (aluminum rod) and highly deformable (rope) objects. A mobile manipulator which consists of an Omni-directional mobile base, a collaborative robotic arm, and a robotic hand is used as the robotic partner in the experiments. Quantitative and qualitative results of a 12-subjects experiment show that the proposed framework can effectively deal with objects of unknown deformability and provides intuitive assistance to human partners. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and development of a robotic system to give physical assistance to the elderly or people with neurological disorders such as Ataxia or Parkin-son's. In particular, we propose using a mobile collaborative robot with an interaction-assistive whole-body interface to help people unable to maintain balance. The robotic system consists of an Omni-directional mobile base, a high-payload robotic arm, and an admittance-type interface acting as a support handle while measuring human-sourced interaction forces. The postural balance of the human body is estimated through the projection of the body Center of Mass (CoM) to the support polygon (SP) representing the quasi-static Center of Pressure (CoP). In response to the interaction forces and the tracking of the human posture, the robot can create assistive forces to restore balance in case of its loss. Otherwise, during normal stance or walking, it will follow the user with minimum/no opposing forces through the generation of coupled arm and base movements. As the balance-restoring strategy, we propose two strategies and evaluate them in a laboratory setting on healthy human participants. Quantitative and qualitative results of a 12-subjects experiment are then illustrated and discussed, comparing the performances of the two strategies and the overall system. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent efforts on wearable robots have focused on augmenting the motor performance and/or protecting the wearer's body with lightweight structures. However, providing human-scale force and structural stiffness usually conflicts with the wearability. Inspired by sandwich-structured composites with high structural strengths, widely employed in both nature and man-made structures, a mechanism of selectively stiffening garments (SSGs) utilizing anisotropic cellular cores and rubber-laminated face sheets is proposed. While the proposed mechanism shows a high compliance allowing for conformity to the wearer's body when unjammed, it provides a significantly high force density when jammed, compared to conventional jamming methods, allowing for the ability to adjust mechanical properties based on the designs and materials. In this paper, various designs of the sandwich jamming structures for the SSGs with analytical characterizations and experimental validations are introduced. Potential applications for force and motion assistance are also demonstrated and impacted mitigation. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

	abstract = {Recently, the potential for assistive devices to enhance the walking activity of the elderly has increased. Elderly have muscle weakness in their lower limbs and they are liable to persistent injuries because of falling on the ground. Lately, different mobility aid robots, especially canes, have been proposed to improve their walking activity. The complicated design and the unsuitability for real-time fall prevention are two main demerits of the proposed cane robots in literature. In this paper, it is proposed to develop a simple yet effective 4-DOF cane robot for real-time fall prevention of elderly to work in two modes namely, normal walking and fall prevention. It consists of a stick that is connected to an omni-directional mobile platform by a simple revolute joint. In the normal walking mode, the cane robot is kinematically controlled to follow the human in the front and achieve a desired distance and orientation apart from the human. The quite short response time that is required to prevent the elderly falling by the cane robot is a challenging problem. So, based on the full dynamic model in the 3D space, an impedance controller whose parameters tuned by the genetic algorithm with force/torque constraints is developed. Additionally, for the sake of using the proposed cane robot by different users with different heights and interactive forces, a model reference adaptive control is imposed to the cane robot to overcome the system uncertainties. The results prove that the four DOFs are enough to prevent falling and the kinematic controller achieves the follow-in-the-front concept accurately as well as the dynamic responses are suitable for real-time fall prevention and ensure the robustness against the uncertainties. © IMechE 2019.},

The mechanical implementation using elastic materials demands a further combination together with controlled compliance to make the intrinsic compliance more effective.

Our actively controlled compliance is achieved via admittance control using closed-loop feedback of the six axis force/torque sensors in the feet. The modeling and theoretical formulation are presented, followed by the simulation study. Further, the control algorithms were validated on a real humanoid robot COMAN with inherent compliance. A series of experimental comparisons were studied, including standing balancing against impacts, straight walking, and omni-directional walking, to demonstrate the necessity and the effectiveness of applying controlled compliance on the basis of physical elasticity to enhance compliant foot-ground interaction for the successful locomotion.
