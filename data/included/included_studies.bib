	abstract = {Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) systems equipped with compliant admittance controllers typically utilize F/T sensors to capture the forces applied by the operator. However, the impedance force feedback generated by the robot's motion and the impedance of the human hand can significantly distort the intentional forces. This distortion can lead to vibrations that compromise both interaction transparency and stability. To address this issue, we propose a variable admittance control strategy that incorporates an Interaction Intention Filter (IIF) and an Enhanced Time-Domain Vibration Observer (ETDVO). We first introduce the concept of the IIF, which is designed based on a frequency-domain analysis of force signals collected from real-world human–robot cooperation tasks. This filter effectively prevents unintended impedance force feedback from being transmitted to the admittance controller. Moreover, to ensure interaction stability across diverse environments, we propose a variable-width time window-based ETDVO for accurately computing the vibration index. By leveraging this index, we introduce a variable admittance control strategy based on exponential mapping, which enables rapid adjustment of the admittance parameters, effectively suppresses vibrations and enhances stability. Finally, the proposed strategy is validated through human–robot cooperative laser tracking experiments conducted on a 7-DoF manipulator. Statistical results from the experiments demonstrate that our approach not only improves interaction transparency but also significantly enhances overall stability. Compared to the stable high-gain admittance controller, the Task Time, Required Energy, and Mean Force are reduced by over 10%, 54%, 58%, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Robots in uncertain realworld environments must perform both goaldirected and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The human hand's exceptional dexterity and compliance, derived from its rigid-soft coupling structure and tendon-driven interphalangeal coordination, inspire robotic grippers capable of versatile grasping and force adaptation. Traditional rigid manipulators lack compliance for delicate tasks, while soft robots often suffer from instability and low load capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose a biomimetic multi-joint composite finger integrating a 3D-printed rigid phalanges (46-51 mm) with dual fabric-reinforced pneumatic bladders, mimicking human finger biomechanics. This hybrid design combines hinge-jointed rigidity and anisotropic fabric constraints, enabling two rotational degrees of freedom with higher radial stiffness, achieving 2.18× higher critical burst pressure (240 kPa) than non-reinforced bladders, while preserving axial compliance. Experimental validation demonstrates a 4.77 N maximum fingertip force at 200 kPa and rapid recovery (< 2s) post-impact. The composite finger exhibits human-like gestures (enveloping, pinching, flipping) and adapts to irregular/fragile objects (e.g., eggs, screws) through coordinated bladder actuation. Assembled into a modular gripper, it sustains 1 kg payloads and executes thin-object flipping via proximal-distal joint synergy. This rigid-soft coupling design bridges compliance and robustness, offering high environmental adaptability for applications in industrial automation, human-robot interaction, and delicate manipulation. © The Author(s), 2025.

These tasks place higher demands on the force control performance of robots, particularly in scenarios where the environment is unknown, making constant force control challenging. This study first analyzes the robot and its interaction model with the environment, highlighting the limitations of traditional force control methods in addressing unknown environmental stiffness. Based on this analysis, a variable admittance control strategy is proposed using the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, enabling the online tuning of admittance parameters through reinforcement learning. Furthermore, this strategy is integrated with a quaternion-based nonlinear model predictive control scheme, ensuring coordination between pose tracking and constant-force control and enhancing overall control performances. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves constant force control accuracy and task execution stability, validating the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Bioinspired active pillar structures, known for their large surface area, mechanical compliance, and diverse deformation modes, have garnered extensive research interest. Among various active pillar structures, liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) pillar arrays are capable of exhibiting significant and reversible anisotropic deformation under cyclic heating and cooling, showing great potential in tunable adhesion, soft robots, and biomedical devices. However, scaling up LCE pillar manufacturing remains challenging, limiting its practical applications. In this work, a solvent-free LCE resin is developed with unique features including simple operating procedure, short fabrication time, and tunable responsive temperature, enabling rapid and large-scale production of LCE pillar arrays. The LCE resin allows for the preparation of complex 3D shapes in addition to film or specimen. The fabrication time can be as short as 4 h, without the need to evaporate solvent. Moreover, the LCE resins can be adjusted with a variable phase transition temperature range from 49.4 °C to 97.7 °C by incorporating non-liquid crystal acrylate chains. The resulting active pillar array structure can undertake sequential actuation upon heating with the tunable actuation temperature. Finally, the application of these pillar arrays in multi-level information encryption is demonstrated. The LCE pillar structure introduced here offers a new strategy for constructing advanced active LCE structures with tunable responsive behavior. © Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences 2025.},

	abstract = {Admittance control is a widely used approach for ensuring compliant robot behavior in physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) tasks. The selection of admittance parameters is crucial, as it directly affects interaction stability. However, this process becomes challenging when the robot's interaction with objects involves not only the human hand but also the task environment. This is because the task environment is often unknown and hard to predict while the models of the human hand have been extensively studied in previous work. To address this issue, this paper proposes an admittance adaptive algorithm that ensures stability in human–robot-environment interaction tasks. This algorithm can adjust damping online without prior information about environments. Specifically, we consider the coupling between the robot, human hand, and task environment, treating them as a whole to analyze interaction stability and construct an energy function. Then, based on the energy function, a passive observer is designed to monitor unstable behaviors during the interaction process. Finally, the algorithm adjusts the damping online based on the observed values. The algorithm was experimentally validated using a custom admittance force feedback device. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm can ensure interaction stability without prior information about environments. In the experiment of writing letters, compared to a constant-parameter admittance controller, the algorithm reduces operator effort while maintaining stability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {By dynamic planning, we refer to the ability of the human brain to infer and impose motor trajectories related to cognitive decisions. A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference – either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control – inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents. We start from a simple unit and gradually describe more advanced structures, comparing recently proposed design choices and providing basic examples. This study distances itself from traditional views centered on neural networks and reinforcement learning, and points toward a yet unexplored direction in active inference: hybrid representations in hierarchical models. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The aim of this contribution is to present the ethical aspects of decision making (DM) in socially assistive robotics (SAR) and discuss the model of active inference (AIF) within this context. The literature has extensively addressed the ethical issues related to SAR, especially concerning trust and justification in the choices and actions made by the robotic agent towards the user and the external environment. However, it is worth considering at a deeper level the technical implementation of DM. Models of AIF recently have been considered attractive for implementing explainable artificial intelligence for DM, with potentially groundbreaking implications for robotics. Indeed, AIF is particularly effective for complex tasks where the dynamics of the robot are uncertain, as these occur in human-robot interaction, and especially in SAR. This contribution tries to provide an encompassing account of the ethical implications of DM for SAR, by focusing on the often overlooked issue of the ethics of technical implementation. We first present the topic of DM for SAR, then discuss relevant ethical implications, and in a third step present the AIF model for DM and its applications in robotics. Finally, we consider whether AIF could serve as a model for implementing ethically sound decision-making processes in socially assistive robotics. © 2025 IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance controller designed to enhance the performance of coupled human–robot systems during motion. The controller integrates the biomechanical characteristics of human limbs and dynamically adjusts the robotic impedance parameters—specifically damping, stiffness, and equilibrium trajectory—based on real-time estimations of the user's intent and direction of motion. The primary goal is to minimize the energy expenditure of the coupled human–robot system while maintaining system passivity. To address uncertainties in human behavior and noisy observations, the controller employs Bayesian optimization combined with a Gaussian process. To validate the proposed approach, human experiments are conducted using a standard robotic arm manipulator. The results demonstrate that the controller eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, a process that is typically time-consuming. A comparative analysis against two variable impedance controllers without user-adaptive parameter adjustments reveal significant benefits, with the controller improving combined performance metrics—such as accuracy, speed, user effort, and smoothness—by over 13%. Notably, all participants in the study preferred the optimized controller over the alternatives. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance control approach and its potential to enhance physical human–robot interaction in various applications that involve repetitive or continuous motion. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic: How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns? To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference on the basis of the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced substantially by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuomotor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience. copyright © 2025 the authors, some rights reserved.},

However, implementing an “innate” GEITH and a set of interactive behaviors allowed us to avoid these limitations and design a mechanism for information search and learning in an open world. The results show that over a few tens of interaction cycles, the robot’s prediction errors decrease, which shows an improvement in the GEITH calibration.

	abstract = {The current study investigated possible human-robot kinaesthetic interactions using a variational recurrent neural network (RNN) model, called PV-RNN, which is based on the free-energy principle. Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between the top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy. The current study examines how changing the meta-prior w in the interaction phase affects the counter force generated when an experimenter attempts to induce movement pattern transitions familiar to the robot through its prior training. The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Finally, the study examines how different levels of disturbances, pattern level, and cognitive level can be resolved internally across different layers. Our experimental results indicated that 1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when w is set with larger/smaller values; 2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions; and 3) when the robot was disturbed in the cognitive level, the disturbance was resolved more in the higher layer as compared to the case with disturbance in the pattern level. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in action intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {For physical human–robot interaction (pHRI), this article proposes a variable admittance control method that integrates both direct human intent and indirect human intent, aimed at enhancing interactive experiences. This method employs a sigmoid function to analyze interaction force signals, enabling the recognition of direct intent. This facilitates a smooth transition between preferences for rapid motion and precise motion. For indirect intent, it draws inspiration from the speed–curvature–torsion pattern reflecting human motion laws in 3-D space. An expected force model is constructed to characterize the long-term motion objectives of indirect intent. Based on a directional admittance guidance mechanism, the estimated indirect intent enables the robot to collaborate with the operator and provide motion guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to fixed admittance control and other variable admittance control methods, the proposed method achieves significant improvements in 3-D spatial path tracking regarding accuracy, smoothness, effort reduction, and task time. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

This study proposes a collaborative control system combining parametrized-surface virtual fixtures and admittance-based hybrid force-position control. The osteotomy surface is extracted from preoperative CT data, projected and spline-fitted to generate virtual constraint. An anisotropic admittance model ensures compliant motion in the cutting direction while enforcing geometric constraints in normal and depth directions. The control scheme was implemented on a UR5e manipulator and validated through three experimental trials on identical anatomical mandible models. Postoperative CT scans were registered to preoperative plans, and cutting accuracy was evaluated using 13 anatomical landmarks per model. The overall mean error was 0.81 mm, with a maximum deviation of 1.48 mm and a standard deviation of 0.53 mm. 3D error map revealed localized deviations. The robot demonstrated stable and responsive behavior across trials, with smooth tool interaction and no safety violations.

	abstract = {Sensing the deformation of soft robots is vital for effective control and interaction with the environment. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables such sensing by monitoring changes in conductivity, but its sensitivity is often highest near the electrodes, limiting performance for distant deformations. Existing strategies to address this limitation typically rely on introducing conductive material heterogeneities, such as anisotropic or patterned conductors, to redirect current flow. In this work, a fundamentally different approach is presented: utilizing a dielectric guide to manipulate the electric field within the conductive body. This method leverages widely used soft robotic materials, such as silicone, in a new role as a passive electric field guide, allowing reconfiguration of sensitivity distributions without embedding conductive components. Physical experiments with a conductive hydrogel cylinder show that the dielectric guide increases deformation sensing accuracy by 21%, reduces sensitivity to noise, and enables a reduction in the number of required EIT channels. This work establishes dielectric-based field manipulation as a novel design strategy for high-fidelity, low-interference proprioception in soft robotics. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In physical human-robot interaction, force feedback has been the most common sensing modality to convey the human intention to the robot. It is widely used in admittance control to allow the human to direct the robot. However, it cannot be used in scenarios where direct force feedback is not available since manipulated objects are not always equipped with a force sensor. In this work, we study one such scenario: the collaborative pushing and pulling of heavy objects on frictional surfaces, a prevalent task in industrial settings. When humans do it, they communicate through verbal and non-verbal cues, where body poses, and movements often convey more than words. We propose a novel context-aware approach using Directed Graph Neural Networks to analyze spatiotemporal human posture data to predict human motion intention for non-verbal collaborative physical manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that robot assistance significantly reduces human effort and improves task efficiency. The results indicate that incorporating posture-based context recognition, either together with or as an alternative to force sensing, enhances robot decision-making and control efficiency. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While undulatory swimming of elongate limbless robots has been extensively studied in open hydrodynamic environments, less research has been focused on limbless locomotion in complex, cluttered aquatic environments. Motivated by the concept of mechanical intelligence [1], where controls for obstacle navigation can be offloaded to passive body mechanics in terrestrial limbless locomotion, we hypothesize that principles of mechanical intelligence can be extended to cluttered hydrodynamic regimes. To test this, we developed an untethered limbless robot capable of undulatory swimming on water surfaces, utilizing a bilateral cable-driven mechanism inspired by organismal muscle actuation morphology to achieve programmable anisotropic body compliance. We demonstrated through robophysical experiments that, similar to terrestrial locomotion, an appropriate level of body compliance can facilitate emergent swim through complex hydrodynamic environments under pure open-loop control. Moreover, we found that swimming performance depends on undulation frequency, with effective locomotion achieved only within a specific frequency range. This contrasts with highly damped terrestrial regimes, where inertial effects can often be neglected. Further, to enhance performance and address the challenges posed by nondeterministic obstacle distributions, we incorporated computational intelligence by developing a real-time body compliance tuning controller based on cable tension feedback. This controller improves the robot's robustness and overall speed in heterogeneous hydrodynamic environments. © 2025 IEEE.},

Our proposed multimodal association mechanism enhances the fusion process, establishing a robust computational methodology. We train the model using a newly collected dataset that captures the grasping dynamics of a soft gripper equipped with multimodal perception capabilities. By incorporating the current state and image differences, the forward model can predict the soft gripper’s physical interaction and movement in the image flow, which amounts to imagining future motion events. Moreover, we showcase effective predictions across modalities as well as for grasping outcomes.

Because of the cute appearance and childlike behavior of social robots, people have conventionally felt that the robots rely on people. In order for robots to be introduced into more situations, such as caregiving, it is also necessary for people to feel that they can rely on robots. The key to making people feel that they can rely on robots is to improve their perception of agency toward the robot. Humans are generally considered to have agency, and they behave actively based on their motivation to achieve certain goals. If a robot behaves actively based on the equivalent of a human's motivation, then the people's perception of agency toward the robot would be improved. We had human participants interact with a robot that had implemented the equivalent of a human's motivation using the Free Energy Principle. Although not statistically significant, the results suggest a possible trend toward improved perception of agency for robots that showed active behavior compared to those that did not. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) is important for seamless collaboration, improved efficiency, and flexibility whilst robots perform their tasks. Unlike many studies that have focused primarily on single-arm manipulator pHRI, this study specifically addressed the pHRI challenges associated with dual-arm manipulator systems, which can be more difficult problems to solve owing to the inclusion of force couplings, kinematic constraints, uncalibrated trajectory deviations, and uncertainties related to the controlled object. Specifically, this study proposed a human-intention estimation and two-level admittance adaptation control scheme for dual-arm manipulators pHRI, to estimate unknown human motion intent, reduce human effort, and implement effective force control under conditions of uncertainty. An adaptive neural network was employed to estimate the unknown human motion intent, enabling two manipulators to actively follow human movements. An object-level force feedback variable damping admittance controller (FFVDAC) was proposed to enhance pHRI compliance and minimize human effort by adjusting the damping parameters. In addition, a novel manipulator-level neural-network-based variable stiffness admittance controller (NNVSAC) was proposed to effectively control the internal forces under conditions of uncertainty. The stability of the object-level FFVDAC and manipulator level NNVSAC were demonstrated through the Routh criterion and Lyapunov stability analysis, respectively. To confirm the feasibility and superiority of the proposed pHRI control scheme, a series of pHRI and dual-arm manipulators cooperation experiments were conducted using two redundant manipulators. The results clearly demonstrated that the proposed control scheme can successfully reduce human effort and internal force oscillations. Moreover, comparative analysis revealed the proposed algorithm's superior performance. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

The robot adopts an inchworm-like peristaltic motion for its bellow-structured body, and it utilizes a self-locking mechanism, realized by exploiting the anisotropic interaction of its reconfigurable fins with the pipe ridges, to achieve the desired locomotion. A feature of the design is that the robot robustly moves by an integral multiple of the ridge-to-ridge distance per actuation cycle, allowing the robot to self-localize within the pipe. Experiments are conducted to characterize the stress-strain relationship of the 3D-printed compliant material (thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)). The results are used in finite element analysis (FEA)-based design of the bellows structure and the fins for achieving the desired compliance and stiffness anisotropy, respectively. Experiments on a robot prototype inside a four-inch drainage pipe have confirmed the utility of the FEA-based design in achieving sound anisotropic fin stiffness, and the robot's capability to travel a fixed number of ridge-to-ridge distances per actuation cycle, determined by the contraction/expansion stroke.

However, they also come with noticeable drawbacks, such as the limited range of sizes available on the market and the standard control modes, which are primarily oriented toward industrial or service applications. To address these limitations, we propose an optimization-based design method to fully exploit the capability of the cobot in performing rehabilitation tasks. In addition, we introduce a novel control architecture based on an admittance-type virtual fixture method, which constrains the motion of the robot along a prescribed path. This approach allows for an intuitive definition of the task to be performed via programming by demonstration and enables the system to operate both passively and actively. In passive mode, the system supports the patient during task execution with additional force, while in active mode, it opposes the motion with a braking force.

	abstract = {Spinal intervention can benefit from advancements in robotic systems, particularly in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Despite their potential, robotic technologies remain limited to selected spine procedures. Meanwhile, complex and time-consuming procedures, such as osteotomy, are still performed manually, impacting surgeon workload and stress. This paper introduces a robotic system to assist surgeons during the drilling of the vertebral body, enhancing precision and improving patient outcomes. The system integrates a pre-planning tool for establishing the desired correction angle, a virtual fixture-based impedance control algorithm to assist the user in following cutting trajectories while safeguarding surrounding structures, and a navigation tool for enhanced procedural guidance. The system consists of a 7 Degree-of-Freedom robotic manipulator equipped with a drilling system attached to its end-effector. System accuracy was validated on 5 vertebral phantoms, achieving tracking errors of 0.39 ± 0.033 mm and 0.74 ± 0.07 mm, margin errors of 0.84 ± 0.17 mm and 0.19 ± 0.5 mm, and angular alignment errors of 0.34 ± 0.16 and 0.13 ± 0.27° for the sagittal and coronal planes, respectively. Additionally, the system's performance was evaluated with real porcine bone, with results demonstrating similar precision and robustness under realistic mechanical properties. A user Study was conducted to evaluate whether the proposed system effectively enhanced user performance compared to a manual control strategy. The results demonstrated reduced deviation from the desired path and fewer instances of the system exceeding predetermined restricted areas when using the proposed system. Additionally, participants rated the proposed system as less mentally and physically demanding in comparison to the traditional control strategy. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Wearable robots, especially those composed of soft materials, are increasingly attracting interest due to their comfort, ease of donning and doffing, and their ability to provide assistance across various applications. In wearable robotics, striking a balance between ensuring low impedance for wearer comfort and providing sufficient assistive force is a notable design challenge. In this study, we propose exploiting impedance variation in accordance with the types of muscle contraction in the human body. Particularly in eccentric muscle contraction, the impedance can help reduce the muscular load, since it exerts force in the same direction as the muscles. To utilize the relation, we proposed a linked-layer jamming mechanism, which adjusts its impedance largely in various directions. This mechanism allows not only a broad variable range of impedance in multiple rotation directions but also directional torque design, even when equipped in human multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joints. By constructing a wearable robot prototype equipped with the proposed linked-layer jamming mechanisms, the effectiveness of this impedance-based assistance approach was confirmed through experiments. The findings from this study present new possibilities in wearable robot design, showing that suitably amplified impedance can assist human motion, potentially enhancing task efficiency and lowering injury risk. This work thus offers a new perspective for researchers in the field of wearable robots, demonstrating that impedance, often minimized in existing designs, can be utilized beneficially when properly amplified. © The Author(s) 2024.

	abstract = {Robot-assisted arthroscopic surgery has been receiving growing attention in the field of orthopedic surgery. Most of the existing robot-assisted surgical systems in orthopedics place more focus on open surgery than minimally invasive surgery (MIS). In traditional arthroscopic surgery, the surgeon needs to hold an arthroscope with one hand while performing the surgical operations with the other hand, which can restrict the dexterity of the surgical performance and increase the cognitive load. On the other hand, the surgeon heavily relies on the arthroscope view when conducting the surgery, whereas the arthroscope view is a largely localized view and lacks depth information. To assist the surgeon in both scenarios, in this work, we develop a two-arm robotic system. The left-arm robot is used as a robot-assisted arthroscope holder, and it can hold the arthroscope still at a designated pose and reject all other potential disturbances, while also allowing the operator to move it via a pedal switch whenever needed. The left-arm robot is implemented with an impedance controller and a gravity iterative learning (Git) scheme, where the former can provide compliant robot behavior, thus ensuring a safe human-robot interaction, while the latter can accurately learn for gravity compensation. The right-arm robot is used as a robot-assisted surgical tool, providing virtual fixture (VF) assistance and haptic feedback during the surgery. The right-arm robot is implemented with a point-based VF algorithm, which can generate VF directly from point clouds in any shape, render force feedback, and deliver it to the operator. Furthermore, the VF, the bone, and the surgical tool position are visualized in a 3D digital environment as additional visual feedback for the operator. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype. The results demonstrate that both arms can provide satisfactory assistance as designed. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Object handover is a fundamental task for collaborative robots, particularly service robots. In in-home assistance scenarios, individuals often face constraints due to their posture and declining physical functions, necessitating high demands on robots for flexible real-time control and intuitive interactions. During robot-to-human handovers, individuals are limited to making perceptual judgements based on the appearance of the object and the consistent behaviour of the robot. This hinders their comprehensive perception and may lead to unexpected dangerous behaviour. Various handover trajectories pose challenges to predictive robot control and motion coordination. Many studies have shown that force guidance can provide adequate information to the receivers. However, force modulation with intention judgements based on velocity, acceleration, or jerk may impede the intended motion and require additional effort. In this paper, starting from a human-to-human handover study, an anisotropic variable force-guided robot-to-human handover control method is proposed to overcome the cognition-reality gap. The retraction motion was decoupled based on a fitted motion plane and a task-related linear trajectory, which served as a reference for overshoot suppression and impedance force modulation. The experimental results and user surveys show that the anisotropic variable impedance force suppresses overshooting without impeding the intended motions, giving the receiver sufficient time for behavioural adjustments and assisting them in completing a safe and efficient handover in a preferred manner. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper presents a mobile supernumerary robotic approach to physical assistance in human–robot conjoined actions. The study starts with the description of the SUPER-MAN concept. The idea is to develop and utilize mobile collaborative systems that can follow human loco-manipulation commands to perform industrial tasks through three main components: (i) an admittance-type interface, (ii) a human–robot interaction controller and (iii) a supernumerary robotic body. Next, we present two possible implementations within the framework — from theoretical and hardware perspectives. The first system is called MOCA-MAN, and is composed of a redundant torque-controlled robotic arm and an omni-directional mobile platform. The second one is called Kairos-MAN, formed by a high-payload 6-DoF velocity-controlled robotic arm and an omni-directional mobile platform. The systems share the same admittance interface, through which user wrenches are translated to loco-manipulation commands, generated by whole-body controllers of each system. Besides, a thorough user-study with multiple and cross-gender subjects is presented to reveal the quantitative performance of the two systems in effort demanding and dexterous tasks. Moreover, we provide qualitative results from the NASA-TLX questionnaire to demonstrate the SUPER-MAN approach's potential and its acceptability from the users’ viewpoint. © 2024},

In this study, we proposed a novel variable admittance model designed for robotic mobile platforms. The proposed admittance model achieves the decoupling of the desired dynamics related to the intended motion direction from that of the unintentional motion, ensuring that changes in one space do not affect the other. In the unintentional space, the admittance parameters remain constant, while the inertia and damping gains along the intended motion direction are adjusted to provide compliance to the human user. The design of these variable terms was performed to ensure a consistent response, aiming to offer a perceived consistent behavior to the human user and to guarantee strict passivity under human force input, ensuring manipulation stability. In addition to theoretical proof of passivity, we validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed control scheme through experimental results using an omni-directional robotic mobile platform. © 2016 IEEE.},

This systematically reasons out the uncertainty in the observed human action, thereby better assessing the potential safety risks during the interaction. Second, based on the computed belief over the human internal states, we formulate a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) problem to plan the robot's actions such that it safely achieves its goal while also actively inferring on the human internal state. To cope with the expensive computation of the SMPC, we develop a sampling-based technique that efficiently evaluates the robot's action conditioned on human uncertainty.

	abstract = {Human–robot collaboration (HRC) systems integrate the strengths of humans and robots to improve joint system performance. In particular, human–robot cooperative manipulation (co-manipulation), a prominent area within the field of HRC, in which humans and robots manipulate the same object, has garnered significant attention. Trust in HRC is crucial in determining the level of human acceptance of robots and, hence, robot utilization. This paper develops a probabilistic dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)-based trust model and trust-aware variable impedance control for human–robot co-manipulation. Due to the continuous nature of trust evolution and the limitation of the classic parameter learning approach, a continuous and normalized version of Baum–Welch (BW) algorithm is developed to learn the trust model. Trust is vital in any HRC task, such as human–robot co-manipulation. To achieve successful co-manipulation, it is necessary to take into account human–robot trust and further facilitate seamless HRC. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive framework with trust-aware variable impedance control of robot behavior for human–robot co-manipulation, based on human trust in robot and force-based human intention estimation, with trust-based obstacle avoidance and trust-based robot-level task hierarchy. An extensive case study on human–robot co-transportation is conducted, encompassing five distinct robot behaviors, namely, compliant, autonomous, switching control-based, variable impedance control based only on human applied force, and our proposed trust-based variable impedance control behaviors. A rigorous statistical analysis is performed to test their statistical significance and our trust-aware variable impedance control strategy demonstrated its superiority in terms of efficiency, agreement, safety, pHRI, and sHRI factors compared to other benchmark behaviors. The statistical findings also indicate that our proposed trust model has the ability to reflect human subjective surveyed trust qualitatively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

From this model, velocity-curvature patterns are derived, enabling an intuitive estimation of indirect intentions indicating long-term objectives like trajectory and turning direction. We propose an innovative guidance method, rooted in the estimation of indirect human intentions, enabling the robot to concurrently follow and guide the operator.

Human limb dynamic model is regarded as mechanical impedance model, and human motion intention is estimated online based on Gaussian process. A variable impedance control method is proposed to make the MRM comply with human motion intention in the process of pHRI. A decentralized sliding mode control strategy is designed to achieve high performance position tracking and compensate the uncertainty of the controller. Based on Lyapunov theory, the uniform ultimately bounded of tracking error of each joint is proved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method under pHRI is verified by experiments.

	abstract = {In this study, an adaptive object deformability-agnostic human-robot collaborative transportation framework is presented. The proposed framework enables to combine the haptic information transferred through the object with the human kinematic information obtained from a motion capture system to generate reactive whole-body motions on a mobile collaborative robot. Furthermore, it allows rotating the objects in an intuitive and accurate way during co-transportation based on an algorithm that detects the human rotation intention using the torso and hand movements. First, we validate the framework with the two extremities of the object deformability range (i.e., purely rigid aluminum rod and highly deformable rope) by utilizing a mobile manipulator which consists of an Omni-directional mobile base and a collaborative robotic arm. Next, its performance is compared with an admittance controller during a co-carry task of a partially deformable object in a 12-subjects user study. Quantitative and qualitative results of this experiment show that the proposed framework can effectively handle the transportation of objects regardless of their deformability and provides intuitive assistance to human partners. Finally, we have demonstrated the potential of our framework in a different scenario, where the human and the robot co-transport a manikin using a deformable sheet. Note to Practitioners - Transportation of objects which requires the cooperation of multiple partners, is a common task in industrial settings such as factories and warehouses. The existing human-robot collaboration solutions for this task have focused only on purely rigid objects, although deformable objects need to be carried frequently in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a human-robot collaborative transportation framework that can handle objects with different deformability ranging from purely rigid to highly deformable. In particular, the proposed framework generates whole-body movements on a mobile collaborative robot by combining of the haptic information transmitted through the object and the human motion information obtained from a motion capture system. Moreover, the framework includes an intuitive way to rotate the object during the execution based on human hand and torso motion. The results of the experiments where objects with various deformability characteristics were transported in collaboration with a mobile manipulator demonstrated the high potential of the proposed approach in a laboratory setting. In the future, we plan to employ a less expensive vision-based human motion tracking system instead of the IMU-based system used in this study.

	abstract = {At present, the serious challenge of human-robot collaboration is how to establish an interaction interface with multi-directional interactivity and robustness. This paper applies surface electromyography (sEMG) signals as the interface medium, and proposes a robust 3D arm strength estimation model based on hybrid deep learning networks (R3DNet) to build a stable interaction interface and achieve reliable human-robot collaboration performance in 3D operation scenarios. R3DNet adopts the modular design idea and includes a feature extraction module, a regression estimation module, and a robust enhancement module. In the feature extraction module, an autoencoder structure-based network and a new loss function are proposed to extract the fusion features of multi-channel sEMG signals. In the regression estimation module, an arm strength model based on transfer learning algorithms is proposed. This model considers the similarity of arm strength estimation in each direction and realizes the arm strength estimation from one to three dimensions through the fine-tune strategy. The robust enhancement module adopts a residual structure and aims to address the problem of poor model robustness due to non-ideal conditions such as electrode displacement, muscle fatigue, muscle time-varying characteristics and differences in muscle characteristics among subjects. Further, an improved adaptive admittance control method is proposed to help the robot to adjust collaborative behavior according to the changing arm strength of the human tutor. The results of comparison experiments and multi-point flexible assembly experiments verify the validity and engineering realizability of R3DNet for human-robot collaboration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The trajectory planning of the arm is greatly facilitated by the physical direct teaching technology. Variable admittance control is a promising technology when a robot is interacting with a variable environment, such as a human whose stiffness might change during the interaction. Nevertheless, a canonical admittance controller with imperfect parameters may lead to robot oscillation, which brings more challenges to a variable admittance controller. In this paper, we propose an energy-based variable admittance controller with intrinsic oscillation suppression property. During the physical human–robot interaction (pHRI), the human intention is predicted based on the robot's state and interaction force. The admittance parameters are tuned automatically to conform the robot's motion to human intention. When the oscillation is detected online by the proposed wavelet module, our variable admittance model reveals oscillation suppression ability because of dissipating the energy generated by high-frequency oscillation. We compared the proposed variable admittance controller with other admittance controller approaches in both simulation and actual robot experiments. The proposed method shows significant improvement in oscillation suppression and human energy conservation in the human–robot interaction application. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

However, control-based approaches are not suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Therefore, applying manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a novel framework for skill learning in robotic manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (TactileAIRL), aimed at achieving efficient learning. To enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference, which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we have designed universal tactile static and dynamic features based on vision-based tactile sensors, making our framework scalable to many manipulation tasks learning involving tactile feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly high training efficiency in objects pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks with just few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline. Furthermore, we conduct physical experiments on a gripper screwing task using our method, which showcases the algorithm's rapid learning capability and its potential for practical applications. © 2024 IEEE.},

To this end, a two-layered learning-based human intention recognition mechanism is proposed, utilizing only the kinematic and kinetic data from the robot and two force sensors. A "subtask detector"recognizes the human intent by estimating which phase of the task is being performed, e.g., Idle, Tool-Attachment, Driving, and Contact. Simultaneously, a "motion estimator"continuously quantifies intent more precisely during the Driving to predict when Contact will begin. The controller is adapted online according to the subtask while allowing early adaptation before the Contact to maximize precision and safety and prevent potential instabilities. Three sets of pHRI experiments were performed with multiple subjects under various conditions. Spring compression experiments were performed in virtual environments to train the data-driven models and validate the proposed adaptive system, and drilling experiments were performed in the physical world to test the proposed methods' efficacy in real-life scenarios. Experimental results show subtask classification accuracy of 84% and motion estimation R<sup>2</sup> score of 0.96. Furthermore, 57% lower human effort was achieved during Driving as well as 53% lower oscillation amplitude at Contact as a result of the proposed system. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease or stroke, relies on the examination of joint rigidity. Clinical rigidity can be quantitatively assessed by the estimation of the static passive component of the joint impedance, known as passive stiffness. Here we propose an experimental setup and a methodology for estimating the passive stiffness of the human wrist across two coupled Degrees of Freedom (DoFs): Flexo-Extension (FE) and Radio-Ulnar Deviation (RUD). A robotic arm passively moved the participant's wrist, whose movements and interaction forces/torques were recorded through infrared cameras and a 6-axis load cell, respectively. Conversely to most previous studies, that approximated wrist angular displacements and torques with the robot joint angles and torques, we considered a wrist kinematic model with two orthogonal axes (FE and RUD) intersecting at the wrist center of rotation. We tested our method on four healthy volunteers and employed multiple linear regression to estimate 2-by-2 stiffness matrix and represent its symmetric component in the form of a stiffness ellipse. The results were comparable with the prior literature. Specifically, the joint stiffness in the FE-RUD space was confirmed to be anisotropic, with the stiffness along RUD higher than along FE, and with the axis of maximum stiffness tilted counterclockwise of a few degrees with respect to the pure RUD axis. © 2024 IEEE.},

In OA-CMABs, external observations are a function of context features and thus provide evidence on top of observed option outcomes to infer hidden parameters. However, if external data is error-prone, measures must be taken to preserve the correctness of inference. To this end, we derive a robust Bayesian inference process for OA-CMABs based on recently developed probabilistic semantic data association techniques, which handle complex mixture model parameter priors and hybrid discrete-continuous observation likelihoods for semantic external data sources. To cope with combined uncertainties in OA-CMABs, we also derive a new active inference algorithm for optimal option selection based on approximate expected free energy minimization. This generalizes prior work on CMAB active inference by accounting for faulty observations and non-Gaussian distributions. Results for a simulated deep space search site selection problem show that, even if incorrect semantic observations are provided externally, e.g. by scientists, efficient decision-making and robust parameter inference are still achieved in a wide variety of conditions. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a climbing machining robot that can adsorb and move on the variable curvature surface of large and complex components to perform machining tasks. Active compliance suction units, which consist of twofold innovation, are proposed for this robot to overcome the bottleneck involving adsorption on the variable curvature surface. To solve the dilemma between high vacuum tolerance and surface compliance capability, we designed a novel trachea-inspired anisotropic stiffness sealing lip for the suction chamber, and it showed flexibility in the adsorption direction for adoption to complex surfaces and presented a high stiffness that can withstand large vacuum forces at its sides. Furthermore, to avoid vacuum leaks due to overstretching and overcompressing of the sealing lip, we developed an active compliance actuator to align the axis direction of the suction chamber with the normal direction of the adsorbed surface and maintain a suitable distance. To meeting strict weight and dimension demands, the actuator innovatively combines cable-driven units and 3-revolute-revolute-spherical parallel mechanism to reach a high load/weight ratio. The prototype of the climbing machining robot was developed and tested on a real large wind-turbine blade with variable curvatures ranging from 1 to 15 m. The experimental results show that the 10 kg-weight climbing machining robot with three ACSUs can provide over 1000 N adsorption force in total, and the fluctuation of adsorption forces can be reduced by 96% compared with that of robots with traditional pure passive compliance suction units. A comparative polishing experiment was executed on different curvature regions of the wind turbine blade, and the results prove that the proposed method can apply uniform polishing. In addition, a polishing-quality verification experiment was realized using the proposed climbing machining robot with a force-controlled polisher.

	abstract = {To be fully integrated into the activities of our daily lives, robots need to be capable of traversing unstructured environments and interacting safely with their surroundings. Soft robots are perfect candidates since they can adapt to their surroundings through passive material compliance, rather than relying on complex control. However, the same compliance hinders the generation of propelling forces, and current approaches face a tradeoff between traveling speed, action range, and control complexity. We overcome this trade-off by developing a locomotion mechanism based on the synergistic interaction between symmetric vibrations, elasticity, and asymmetric morphology. We then realize a rapid soft locomotor using inexpensive off-the-shelf components and requiring only elementary actuation and control. A single robotic unit can travel at speeds up to 100 mm/s when tethered and 35 mm/s when untethered. We derive a model that predicts the speed of the robot as a function of several design parameters and physical properties, highlighting the role of geometric asymmetries in the resulting anisotropic motion. Moreover, these elementary units can be added together to create more complex behaviors. By adding 2 units in parallel, the assembly can locomote and be steered following nonholonomic constraints. Our approach opens the door to a new class of low-cost soft robots that can travel fast and far with elementary fabrication and control, and which can be combined to achieve complex functions without compromising their essential simplicity. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

In this article, we developed a simple three-dimensional printable micro/macro dual driving multipede millirobot to successfully satisfy both high precision and high velocity, by employing bio-inspired titled legs through the concept of anisotropic friction. Four locomotory modes (stick, stick-slip, pure-slip, and jumping) of the millirobot were carefully examined and effectively manipulated to switch micro and macro motions for high precision and high velocity, respectively. We investigated the effects of external conditions (mobile surface roughness and excitation waveform) and internal conditions (geometric parameters of driving legs) on the locomotory modes. The millirobot achieved a step resolution of 2 μm in the micromotion and maximum mobile velocity of 800 mm/s in the macromotion. In addition, our millirobot can perform bi-directional motion (forward and backward) with quick return characteristics. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Soft robots can adapt to dynamic environments without prior knowledge of their properties. Plants inspire mechanisms for counterbalancing dynamic loads by locally modulating compliance through anisotropic humidity-responsive materials and structures. In addition to well-known passive bilayers, plants may also actively control swelling. The combination of robust hygroscopic material-level response and simple electrical control makes active swelling particularly attractive for technological implementation. However, dynamic swelling demands the development and optimisation of congruent pumping solutions. This work suggests electrohydrodynamic pumping, enabled by highly reversible ion immobilisation at capacitive electrodes, as a particularly suitable low-pressure, high-area liquid displacement solution for active swelling. Local pore fill ratio (PFR) modulation is used as a measure for dynamic liquid displacement and swelling. A method for highly localised (10 μm membrane thickness) assessment of the dynamic variation of PFR in a 400 μm laminate undergoing cross-plane electrokinetic liquid displacement is developed. Two modes for transient PFR modulation were identified: electrokinetic ion transfer and diffusive solvent redistribution, pronounced at high and low voltage scan rates, respectively. The strategic combination of these modes enables various compliance-modulation scenarios. The system contains (within a cycle) a constant amount of liquid in an open network of liquid-filled pores. 30%-75% PFR yielded the highest dynamic PFR modulation: a high amount of empty pores is beneficial, yet a too-low PFR compromises the continuous liquid pathway necessary for electrokinetic pumping. The dynamic nature of internal liquid rearrangement was characterised by relatively fast electrokinetics-driven fluxes (6.3% PFR change in 80 s), followed by a slow equilibration of concentration and PFR. At high scan rates, PFR decreased at positive polarisation, while both positive and negative polarity yielded a similar decrease at low scan rates (5 mV s<sup>−1</sup>). Localised control over the swelling gradient enables the design of systems that morphologically adapt to complex dynamic loading conditions. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Intuitive and comfortable physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) can be realized by changing impedance/admittance parameters corresponding to human interaction. However, this dynamic adjustment may result in drastically changed system dynamics, which usually give rise to system instability. We introduce a power envelope regulation strategy designed to constrain the variability of admittance parameters, thereby ensuring system passivity and mitigating the risk of instability. Then, sliding mode control (SMC) is employed to yield stable and robust performance. A new sliding surface is proposed based on feedback linearization, which shows improved tracking performance and stability compared to a conventional sliding surface. The effectiveness of the proposed sliding surface and associated control is theoretically validated. Notably, our modified sliding surface works universally, regardless of the order of the desired admittance equation. The trade-off between system chattering and robustness is effectively managed using a variable–boundary approach, which dynamically adjusts system constraints to optimize performance. In addition, a control algorithm combining acceleration feedback and sliding mode is proposed, showing improved robustness and tracking accuracy performance compared with applying the proposed SMC algorithm exclusively. The efficacy of these methodologies is substantiated through numerical simulations and empirical experiments. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Confined space searches such as pipeline inspections are widely demanded in various scenarios, where lightweight soft robots with inherent compliance to adapt to unstructured environments exhibit good potential. We proposed a tubular soft robot with a simple structure of a spring-rolled dielectric elastomer (SRDE) and compliant passive bristles. Due to the compliance of the bristles, the proposed robots can work in pipelines with inner diameters both larger and smaller than the one of the bristles. Firstly, the nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the SRDE were investigated experimentally. Then, we fabricated the proposed robot with a bristle diameter of 19 mm and then studied its performance in pipelines on the ground with inner diameters of 18 mm and 20 mm. When the pipeline’s inner diameter was less than the outer diameter of the bristles, the bristles remained in the state of bending and the robot locomotion is mainly due to anisotropic friction (1.88 and 0.88 body lengths per second horizontally and vertically, respectively, in inner diameter of 18 mm and 0.06 body length per second in that of 16 mm). In the case of the pipeline with the larger inner diameter, the bristles were not fully constrained, and a small bending moment applied on the lower bristle legs contributed to the robot’s locomotion, leading to a high velocity (2.78 body lengths per second in 20 mm diameter acrylic pipe). In addition, the robot can work in varying geometries, such as curving pipes (curve radius ranges from 0.11 m to 0.31 m) at around two body lengths per second horizontally and on the ground at 3.52 body lengths per second, showing promise for pipeline or narrow space inspections. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study explains how the leader-follower relationship and turn-taking could develop in a dyadic imitative interaction by conducting robotic simulation experiments based on the free energy principle. Our prior study showed that introducing a parameter during the model training phase can determine leader and follower roles for subsequent imitative interactions. The parameter is defined as (Formula presented.), the so-called meta-prior, and is a weighting factor used to regulate the complexity term versus the accuracy term when minimizing the free energy. This can be read as sensory attenuation, in which the robot’s prior beliefs about action are less sensitive to sensory evidence. The current extended study examines the possibility that the leader-follower relationship shifts depending on changes in (Formula presented.) during the interaction phase. We identified a phase space structure with three distinct types of behavioral coordination using comprehensive simulation experiments with sweeps of (Formula presented.) of both robots during the interaction. Ignoring behavior in which the robots follow their own intention was observed in the region in which both (Formula presented.) s were set to large values. One robot leading, followed by the other robot was observed when one (Formula presented.) was set larger and the other was set smaller. Spontaneous, random turn-taking between the leader and the follower was observed when both (Formula presented.) s were set at smaller or intermediate values. Finally, we examined a case of slowly oscillating (Formula presented.) in anti-phase between the two agents during the interaction. The simulation experiment resulted in turn-taking in which the leader-follower relationship switched during determined sequences, accompanied by periodic shifts of (Formula presented.) s. An analysis using transfer entropy found that the direction of information flow between the two agents also shifted along with turn-taking. Herein, we discuss qualitative differences between random/spontaneous turn-taking and agreed-upon sequential turn-taking by reviewing both synthetic and empirical studies. © 2023 by the authors.},

This work was motivated by the benefits provided by passively and directionally compliant legs in humans and animals. UPed uses under-actuated legs based on the bent-knee model which is capable of changing the direction and magnitude of the leg compliance by adjusting the knee angle and distal leg stiffness. Pneumatic pistons were chosen as variable compliance elements, enabling the leg compliance to be adjusted during locomotion. The platform was validated experimentally by evaluating how the robot's pitch rate and cost of transport changed with variations in leg compliance and knee angle. Results of these experiments indicated that significant performance improvements are possible by selecting appropriate values of compliance and knee angle. They also demonstrated a unique capability to explore adjustable directional compliance and other parameters in robot legs on a physical robotic system. UPed has the potential to facilitate significant performance improvements of legged robots by enabling additional in-depth studies on directional passive leg compliance. © 2022 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Children naturally engage in pretend play with others in their daily life. The children share each other's expectations toward objects and people around them. Such expectation-sharing can be considered the fundamental process of social communication, where we exchange beliefs, desires, and intentions. Firstly, the present paper examines some cases of such expectation-sharing in pretend play observed in our longitudinal robot-mediated interaction with 27 preschoolers (3-to-4-year-olds) at a kindergarten. The robot, which the researchers in another room remotely controlled, has a simple appearance and motion to accept various expectations from the children. The robot functioned as a pivot for the children to exchange each other's expectations towards the robot, toys, and people. The children might bring expectations incongruent with each other, but such expectations gradually converged into a consistent one, on which they understood each other's verbal and non-verbal actions. Secondly, this paper interprets and models these cases using the predictive coding theory. According to the theory, the children project their predictions onto the shared environment and update the predictions by minimizing the error against reality. This act of projection, which was performed as labeling (e.g., a block as a rice ball) or pretend action (e.g., feeding it to the robot) by the children, is a form of active inference to modify the environment to match the prediction. The children exchanged and coordinated their predictions through visible action collectively accumulated in the playing environment around the robot. We conclude that joint prediction is the fundamental process of social communication, where we coordinate each other's behavior for collaboration. © 2023 IEEE.},

Soft crawling robots may be widely applied to travel across complex environment, such as post-disaster search and rescue, environmental exploration, medical surgery, and so on. Soft crawling robots can move forward through elongating and contracting their bodies, but the smooth body surfaces like silicone material have limited their speed of movement. In nature, soft animals use their scales or setae to increase friction anisotropy and propel their bodies forward. Using biologically-inspired skin is an recognized way to increase the movement speed of soft crawling robots effectively. The directionality of the snake scales can produce anisotropic friction with the ground when moving forward, which is necessary to promote the movement of the snake. Inspired by snake scales, we developed a hard scale structure that can be fixed to the bottom of the pneumatic actuators. These scales can generate friction force when in contact with the substrate surface, which increases the speed of this soft crawling robot. © 2023 IEEE.},

This paper investigates the adversarial capabilities for destabilizing the interaction dynamics between human drivers and vehicle haptic shared control (HSC) steering systems. In contrast to the conventional robotics literature, where the main objective is to render the human-automation interaction dynamics stable by ensuring passivity, this paper takes the exact opposite route. In particular, to investigate the damaging capabilities of a successful cyber-physical attack, this paper demonstrates that an attacker who targets the HSC steering system can destabilize the interaction dynamics between the human driver and the vehicle HSC steering system through synthesis of time-varying impedance profiles. Specifically, it is shown that the adversary can utilize a properly designed non-passive and time-varying adversarial impedance target dynamics, which are fed with a linear combination of the human driver and the steering column torques. Using these target dynamics, it is possible for the adversary to generate in realtime a reference angular command for the driver input device and the directional control steering assembly of the vehicle. Furthermore, it is shown that the adversary can make the steering wheel and the vehicle steering column angular positions to follow the reference command generated by the time-varying impedance target dynamics using proper adaptive control strategies. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of such time-varying impedance attacks, which result in a non-passive and inherently unstable interaction between the driver and the HSC steering system. © 2023 IEEE.},

First, image registration includes two parts: using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to register the point cloud of Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) image and oral scanning image, and using the method based on feature points to register the oral scanning model and visual space. Then, the transformation from the robot flange frame to the dental drill frame was obtained through robot hand-eye calibration, and the image space was connected to the visual space using a binocular vision system, thus realizing visual navigation. Finally, the admittance control was used to guide the robot to locate the root canal orifice, and a linear virtual fixture was applied to constrain the drilling direction. The results of surgical navigation experiment and model drilling experiment show that the image registration error is less than 1mm, the robot drilling position error is less than 1 mm, and the angle error is about 5 degrees, which meets the clinical accuracy requirements. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)-based robotic tactile sensing holds great promise for future robot technology by geometrical scalability, mechanical durability, and ease of fabrication. The current EIT-based approach demonstrates wide success in measuring distributed normal tactile stimuli by reconstructing the scalar of the electrical conductivity. As an advancement, we propose a theoretical investigation on measuring conductivity tensor distribution using EIT, empowered by the deep neural network, that would facilitate a multi-modal tactile measurement on both the normal and shear inputs. An architecture based on Convolutional neural network and spatial sensitivity awareness on the loss function demonstrates the high-performing nonlinear tensor reconstruction that yet has not been proposed to date. Along with a sim-to-real approach for extensive investigation on conductivity tensor combinations, computationally efficient and robust (well-posed) model training was achieved, which results in a generalized reconstruction capability. Extensive simulation studies on reconstruction accuracy, noise robustness, and generalized reconstruction capability are presented. This preliminary investigation would be a substantial basis for constructing a new type of tactile sensor measuring distributed multi-modal tactile sensing. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Estimation of dynamic uncertainties is a critical and fundamental problem when designing a control system for a robot. During robot-environment interaction, in addition to the internal dynamic model uncertainties, the external environment-exerted force will also enter the dynamics. For robot impedance control, an exact dynamic model of the robot is needed but usually not available. It has been shown that integrating an impedance controller with a disturbance observer can achieve accurate impedance control. However, it works only for robots in free motion but not robot-environment interaction. Although a disturbance observer is able to accurately estimate the dynamic uncertainties, the estimation is lumped uncertainties that contain all uncertainty sources including both the internal and the external disturbances. Without separating these two parts, the method of combining an impedance controller and an observer will result in the human-applied force being canceled instead of interacting with the robot. To solve this problem in this paper, we propose a framework for learning the internal disturbances and separating the external disturbances by integrating three entities: an impedance controller, a neural network (NN) model, and a disturbance observer. In the framework, the impedance controller provides compliant robot behavior, while the observer captures the lumped uncertainties, and the NN learns to separate the external disturbances. Simulation results of an application scenario with an obstructive virtual fixture demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Creating autonomous robots that can actively explore the environment, acquire knowledge and learn skills continuously is the ultimate achievement envisioned in cognitive and developmental robotics. Importantly, if the aim is to create robots that can continuously develop through interactions with their environment, their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e. controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in AI and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The compliant nature of vine robots, or everted tubes, makes them very useful for passively navigating sensitive and cluttered environments. Like many soft robots, their compliance makes kinematic modeling difficult. This work seeks to validate the assumption that everted tubes can be modeled as an inflated cantilever beam. The tip deflection and curvature of tubes constructed from Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) and commercially available silicone coated nylon, two commonly used materials for everted tube robots, were measured under several different loading conditions in both everted and non-everted configurations. Our data show that everted tubes constructed from LDPE can be modeled with Comer's model for inflated isotropic beams, which has been assumed in recent literature. In contrast, this model did not fit the silicone coated nylon beams' behavior. This is because of the anisotropic properties of fabric the current model does not consider. Results also showed that everted tubes collapsed before the modeled maximum loading condition at a constant tip displacement, whereas uneverted tubes collapsed slightly after the modeled maximum load. From the inflated beam model, we present an iterative approach to computing the forward kinematics of an everted tube in contact with an obstacle within an environment. This allows for estimating contact forces and determining the static pose of an everted tube. © 2023 IEEE.},

However, in robot control, moving an arm’s end-effector to a target position or along a target trajectory requires accurate forward and inverse models. Here we show that by learning the transition (forward) model from interaction, we can use it to drive the learning of an amortized policy. Hence, we revisit policy optimization in relation to the deep active inference framework and describe a modular neural network architecture that simultaneously learns the system dynamics from prediction errors and the stochastic policy that generates suitable continuous control commands to reach a desired reference position. We evaluated the model by comparing it against the baseline of a linear quadratic regulator, and conclude with additional steps to take toward human-like motor control. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Our approach allows the full control of the co-carrying trajectories by the person while sharing the load with multiple robots depending on the size and the weight of the object. This is achieved by merging the haptic information transferred through the object and the human motion information obtained from a motion capture system. One important advantage of the framework is that no strict internal communication is required between the robots, regardless of the object size and deformation characteristics. We validate the framework with two challenging real-world scenarios: co-transportation of a wooden rigid closet and a bulky box on top of forklift moving straps, with the latter characterizing deformable objects. In order to evaluate the generalizability of the proposed framework, a heterogenous team of two mobile manipulators that consist of an Omni-directional mobile base and a collaborative robotic arm with different DoFs is chosen for the experiments. The qualitative comparison between our controller and the baseline controller (i.e., an admittance controller) during these experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework especially when co-carrying deformable objects. Furthermore, we believe that the performance of our framework during the experiment with the lifting straps offers a promising solution for the co-transportation of bulky and ungraspable objects. © 2023 IEEE.},

Many biological tissues, represented by muscles, exhibit directionally dependent mechanical and electrical properties.

Here, we present the bioinspired concepts, design principles, numerical modeling, and experimental demonstrations of soft elastomer composites with programmed mechanical and electrical anisotropies, as well as their integrations with active functionalities.

Finite element analyses quantitatively capture the key aspects that govern mechanical anisotropies of elastomer composites, providing a powerful design tool. Incorporation of 3D skeletons of thermally responsive polycaprolactone into elastomer composites allows development of an active artificial material that can mimic adaptive mechanical behaviors of skeleton muscles at relaxation and contraction states. Furthermore, the fabrication process of anisotropic elastomer composites is compatible with dielectric elastomer actuators, indicating potential applications in humanoid artificial muscles and soft robots. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Soft robots made from soft materials show great advantages over rigid robots in environmental adaptability and motion flexibility. However, too soft body makes them lose the load capacity, which limits their applications in locomotion. Although the crawling tensegrity robots with both rigid bars and flexible cables are potential to address this challenge, the existing inchworm friction drive methods are difficult to realize the motion of a single tensegrity unit. Besides, the lack of appropriate soft actuators and robot configuration also blocks the development of the crawling tensegrity robots. This article presents a new inchworm driving method realized by the inclined supporting feet. By using the twisted artificial muscle (TAM) as actuator, the combination of the TAM and the inclined supporting feet endows a single three-bar tensegrity unit with multimotion capacity and anisotropic stiffness characteristics. The designed tensegrity robot not only has high compliance but also displays high stiffness, which endows it with high load capacity. The prototype can carry a load of 150 g (7.5 times of its weight) to achieve straight and turning motions.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for real-time classification of subtasks in a physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) task involving contact with a stiff environment. In this regard, we consider three subtasks for a given pHRI task: Idle, Driving, and Contact. Based on this classification, the parameters of an admittance controller that regulates the interaction between human and robot are adjusted adaptively in real time to make the robot more transparent to the operator (i.e. less resistant) during the Driving phase and more stable during the Contact phase. The Idle phase is primarily used to detect the initiation of task. Experimental results have shown that the ANN model can learn to detect the subtasks under different admittance controller conditions with an accuracy of 98% for 12 participants. Finally, we show that the admittance adaptation based on the proposed subtask classifier leads to 20% lower human effort (i.e. higher transparency) in the Driving phase and 25% lower oscillation amplitude (i.e. higher stability) during drilling in the Contact phase compared to an admittance controller with fixed parameters. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Remote manipulation plays a key role for applications in hazardous conditions, yet designing a robust controller enabling safe interaction with unknown environment and under the influence of disturbances is a challenge. In this study, we propose effective control and optimization methods for mobile robotic manipulator systems that can increase effort transmission to a task in desired directions. The vehicle position is optimized by utilizing constrained particle swarm optimization where the objective is to enhance directional manipulability of the robotic arm within the system. A forward dynamic controller is implemented to eliminate undesired excessive motions near singular joint configurations. A reset control algorithm along with an admittance type controller are developed for stable interaction with an unknown object under environmental disturbances. The experimentally validated results show that the proposed method phase out undesired position disturbances and increase the directional manipulability for the required task enabling augmented effort transmission for the task execution. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Human intention adaptation is usually realized by changing impedance/admittance parameters according to human interaction in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). However, determining which admittance parameters need to be updated and how to update depends on the context of pHRI and system stability. This paper aims to provide a systematic study for all three admittance parameters considering human intention adaptation and system passivity for ensuring an intuitive and safe pHRI. For intuitiveness, a general human intention framework based on the robot's roles is summarized as a premise for designing human intention-oriented updating rules for admittance parameters. For the changing trends of these parameters (i.e., increasing or decreasing), only those impacting system passivity are studied. A power envelope regulation (PER) concept is then proposed to impose constraints on variable admittance parameters inferred from human intention for maintaining safe interaction. Our initial results suggest that the passivity condition is not a sufficient condition for system stability in pHRI, whereas preserving the power envelope inferred from the passivity condition can maintain passivity as well as avoid mismatch of admittance parameters arising from unpredicted human interaction. As a result, drastic changes in admittance controller dynamics, which usually result in instability, are restrained. The effectiveness of our approaches not only to maintain intuitive interaction but also to preserve passivity is validated via numerical simulation and experiments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Surgical robot is one of the most important application fields of human-robot collaboration. Since the operating objects are often fragile human tissues, how to improve the safety of the surgical process is the key for practical application of surgical robots. General human-robot interaction methods for safety such as collision detection and obstacle avoidance are relatively passive and robot-based, having difficulty in dealing with complex surgical scenarios. Virtual Fixture(VF), an active motion constraint method, is more suitable for shared control in surgical scenarios. This paper introduces a combination of VF method with admittance control for avoiding damage to robot or tissues while complying with doctor's intention. Firstly, in order to obtain the human-robot interaction force, a statistical method for six-dimensional force sensor calibration is proposed. Then, two velocity-based admittance control models are compared by simulation, and the first order inertial model is selected. On the basis of these, a variety of hard VFs with visual information are established. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method and the causes of violation are analyzed by experiments on a serial robot manipulator. © 2022 IEEE.},

The robotic system consists of an Omni-directional mobile base, a high-payload robotic arm, and an admittance-type interface acting as a support handle while measuring human-sourced interaction forces. The postural balance of the human body is estimated through the projection of the body Center of Mass (CoM) to the support polygon (SP) representing the quasi-static Center of Pressure (CoP). In response to the interaction forces and the tracking of the human posture, the robot can create assistive forces to restore balance in case of its loss. Otherwise, during normal stance or walking, it will follow the user with minimum/no opposing forces through the generation of coupled arm and base movements. As the balance-restoring strategy, we propose two strategies and evaluate them in a laboratory setting on healthy human participants. Quantitative and qualitative results of a 12-subjects experiment are then illustrated and discussed, comparing the performances of the two strategies and the overall system. © 2022 IEEE.},

Inspired by sandwich-structured composites with high structural strengths, widely employed in both nature and man-made structures, a mechanism of selectively stiffening garments (SSGs) utilizing anisotropic cellular cores and rubber-laminated face sheets is proposed. While the proposed mechanism shows a high compliance allowing for conformity to the wearer's body when unjammed, it provides a significantly high force density when jammed, compared to conventional jamming methods, allowing for the ability to adjust mechanical properties based on the designs and materials. In this paper, various designs of the sandwich jamming structures for the SSGs with analytical characterizations and experimental validations are introduced.

	abstract = {Recently, the potential for assistive devices to enhance the walking activity of the elderly has increased. Elderly have muscle weakness in their lower limbs and they are liable to persistent injuries because of falling on the ground. Lately, different mobility aid robots, especially canes, have been proposed to improve their walking activity. The complicated design and the unsuitability for real-time fall prevention are two main demerits of the proposed cane robots in literature. In this paper, it is proposed to develop a simple yet effective 4-DOF cane robot for real-time fall prevention of elderly to work in two modes namely, normal walking and fall prevention. It consists of a stick that is connected to an omni-directional mobile platform by a simple revolute joint. In the normal walking mode, the cane robot is kinematically controlled to follow the human in the front and achieve a desired distance and orientation apart from the human. The quite short response time that is required to prevent the elderly falling by the cane robot is a challenging problem. So, based on the full dynamic model in the 3D space, an impedance controller whose parameters tuned by the genetic algorithm with force/torque constraints is developed. Additionally, for the sake of using the proposed cane robot by different users with different heights and interactive forces, a model reference adaptive control is imposed to the cane robot to overcome the system uncertainties. The results prove that the four DOFs are enough to prevent falling and the kinematic controller achieves the follow-in-the-front concept accurately as well as the dynamic responses are suitable for real-time fall prevention and ensure the robustness against the uncertainties. © IMechE 2019.},

	abstract = {Understanding information processing in the brain—and creating general-purpose artificial intelligence—are long-standing aspirations of scientists and engineers worldwide. The distinctive features of human intelligence are high-level cognition and control in various interactions with the world including the self, which are not defined in advance and are vary over time. The challenge of building human-like intelligent machines, as well as progress in brain science and behavioural analyses, robotics, and their associated theoretical formalisations, speaks to the importance of the world-model learning and inference. In this article, after briefly surveying the history and challenges of internal model learning and probabilistic learning, we introduce the free energy principle, which provides a useful framework within which to consider neuronal computation and probabilistic world models. Next, we showcase examples of human behaviour and cognition explained under that principle. We then describe symbol emergence in the context of probabilistic modelling, as a topic at the frontiers of cognitive robotics. Lastly, we review recent progress in creating human-like intelligence by using novel probabilistic programming languages. The striking consensus that emerges from these studies is that probabilistic descriptions of learning and inference are powerful and effective ways to create human-like artificial intelligent machines and to understand intelligence in the context of how humans interact with their world. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Despite the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, there are many tooling tasks with cognitive aspects that are rather challenging for robots to handle in full autonomy, thus still requiring a certain degree of interaction with a human operator. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for both planning and execution of robot-surface contact tasks whereby interaction with a human operator can be accommodated to a variable degree. The starting point is the geometry of surface, which we assume known and available in a discretized format, e.g. through scanning technologies. To allow for realtime computation, rather than interacting with thousands of vertices, the robot only interacts with a single proxy, i.e. a massless virtual object constrained to ‘live on’ the surface and subject to first order viscous dynamics. The proxy and an impedance-controlled robot are then connected through tuneable and possibly viscoelastic coupling, i.e. (virtual) springs and dampers. On the one hand, the proxy slides along discrete geodesics of the surface in response to both viscoelastic coupling with the robot and to a possible external force (a virtual force which can be used to induce autonomous behaviours). On the other hand, the robot is free to move in 3D in reaction to the same viscoelastic coupling as well as to a possible external force, which includes an actual force exerted by a human operator. The proposed approach is multi-objective in the sense that different operational (autonomous/collaborative) and interactive (for contact/non-contact tasks) modalities can be realized by simply modulating the viscoelastic coupling as well as virtual and physical external forces. We believe that our proposed framework might lead to a more intuitive interfacing to robot programming, as opposed to standard coding. To this end, we also present numerical and experimental studies demonstrating path planning as well as autonomous and collaborative interaction for contact tasks with a free-form surface. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {During communication, humans express their emotional states using various modalities (e.g., facial expressions and gestures), and they estimate the emotional states of others by paying attention to multimodal signals. To ensure that a communication robot with limited resources can pay attention to such multimodal signals, the main challenge involves selecting the most effective modalities among those expressed. In this study, we propose an active perception method that involves selecting the most informative modalities using a criterion based on energy minimization. This energy-based model can learn the probability of the network state using energy values, whereby a lower energy value represents a higher probability of the state. A multimodal deep belief network, which is an energy-based model, was employed to represent the relationships between the emotional states and multimodal sensory signals. Compared to other active perception methods, the proposed approach demonstrated improved accuracy using limited information in several contexts associated with affective human–robot interaction. We present the differences and advantages of our method compared to other methods through mathematical formulations using, for example, information gain as a criterion. Further, we evaluate performance of our method, as pertains to active inference, which is based on the free energy principle. Consequently, we establish that our method demonstrated superior performance in tasks associated with mutually correlated multimodal information. © © 2021 Horii and Nagai.},

	abstract = {In order to interact seamlessly with robots, users must infer the causes of a robot’s behavior–and be confident about that inference (and its predictions). Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, and despite its crucial role, it is still largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human relationship to technological systems. In the following paper we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, HRC, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that it is a trade-off between benevolence and competence; while studies of human to human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We go on to introduce a model of trust as an agent’ best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be casted in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. Interactive feedback is a necessary condition to the extension of the trustor’s perception-action cycle. This model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration–as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust, such as the benevolence and competence attributed to the trustee, to be defined in terms of hierarchical active inference, while vulnerability can be described in terms of information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model emphasizes the role of user feedback during HRC and suggests that boredom and surprise may be used in personalized interactions as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. The description of trust as a sense of virtual control offers a crucial step toward grounding human factors in cognitive neuroscience and improving the design of human-centered technology. Furthermore, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems. © Copyright © 2021 Schoeller, Miller, Salomon and Friston.},

	abstract = {Electroactive polymers (EAPs), especially dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), belong to a very promising and emerging class of functional materials. While DEAs are mostly utilized to rely on carbon-based electrodes, there are certain shortcomings of the use of carbon electrodes in the field of soft robotics. In this work we present a fish-like bending structure to serve as possible propulsion element, completely avoiding carbon-based electrodes. The presented robot is moving under water, using a particularly tailored conductive hydrogel as inner electrode and a highly anisotropic textile material to manipulate the bending behavior of the robot. The charge separation to drive two DEAs on the outsides of the robot is provided by the conductive hydrogel while the surrounding water serves as counter electrode. To characterize the hydrogel, tensile tests and impedance spectroscopy are used as measurement methods of choice. The performance of the robot was evaluated using a digital image correlation (DIC) measurement for its bending deflections under water. The developed fish-like robot was able to perform a dynamic bending movement, based on a tri-stable actuator setup. The performed measurements underpin the sufficient characteristics for an underwater application of conductive hydrogel electrodes as well as the applicability of the robotic concept for under water actuations. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This article presents a multi-degree-of-freedom variable damping controller to manage the trade-off between stability and agility and to reduce user effort in physical human-robot interaction. The controller accounts for the human body's inherent impedance properties and applies a range of robotic damping from negative (energy injection) to positive (energy dissipation) values based on the user's intent of motion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in balancing the trade-off between stability/agility and reducing user effort, two studies are performed on both the human upper-extremity and lower-extremity to represent both industrial and rehabilitation applications of the proposed controller. These studies required subjects to perform a series of multidimensional target reaching tasks while the human user interacted with either the end-effector of a robotic arm for the upper-extremity study or a wearable ankle robot for the lower-extremity study. Stability, agility, and user effort are quantified by a variety of performance metrics. Stability is quantified by both overshoot and stabilization time. Mean and maximum speed are used to quantify agility. To quantify the user effort, both overall and maximum muscle activation, and mean and maximum root-mean-squared interaction force are calculated. The results of both the upper- and lower-extremity studies demonstrate that the controller is able to reduce user effort while increasing agility at a negligible cost to stability. © 2013 IEEE.},

While translational movements are easily understandable for a human, rotational ones do not have an immediate interpretation. This does not allow the operator to achieve an adequate positioning accuracy when a target orientation is set. In this work, a suitable strategy that facilitates the human in accomplishing rotational motion is proposed through the formulation of rotational virtual fixtures. This is obtained thanks to a clever description of the orientation that allows to draw an equivalence between the formulation of translational virtual fixtures and their rotational counterparts. To further improve the human comprehension of the best motion direction in the rotational world, a variable admittance control is also designed. We finally propose to jointly exploit these techniques to achieve the best possible performance in terms of positioning accuracy. The performance are evaluated by means of rotational point to point cooperative motions involving several subjects and an ABB IRB-140 robot. © 2016 IEEE.},

This functionality is enabled by the high compliance of the robotic structure, which comprises very few parts, is easily fabricated, achieves both high precision and performance, and is sufficiently predictable to be controlled in open and closed loop. To demonstrate the locomotive and steering capabilities of the SMARTI, we present a series of experimental tests, including open-loop crawling, closed-loop path following, and high-speed controlled turning. These experiments were performed using amotion capture system for sensing and an off-board digital signal processor for control. In closed loop, the SMARTI reaches a maximum sustained speed of 46 mm/s, equivalent to 3.54 body-lengths per second (BL/s), and a turning rate of 107 degrees per second (D/s) with root-mean-square (RMS) tracking errors as low as 1.7mm.

	abstract = {Uneven terrain in natural environments challenges legged locomotion by inducing instability and causing limb collisions. During the swing phase, the limb releases from the ground and arcs forward to target a secure next foothold. In natural environments leg-obstacle collisions may occur during the swing phase which can result in instability, and may require contact sensing and trajectory re-planning if a collision occurs. However, collision detection and response often requires computationally- and temporally-expensive control strategies. Inspired by low stiffness limbs that can pass past obstacles in small insects and running birds, we investigated a passive method for overcoming swing-collisions. We implemented virtual compliance control in a robot leg that allowed us to systematically vary the limb stiffness and ultimately its response to collisions with obstacles in the environment. In addition to applying a standard positional control during swing motion, we developed two virtual compliance methods: (1) an isotropic compliance for which perturbations in the x and y directions generated the same stiffness response, and (2) a vertical anisotropic compliance in which a decrease of the upward y vertical limb stiffness enabled the leg to move upwards more freely. The virtual compliance methods slightly increased variability along the limb's planned pathway, but the anisotropic compliance control improved the successful negotiation of step obstacles by over 70% compared to isotropic compliance and positional control methods. We confirmed these findings in simulation and using a self-propelling bipedal robot walking along a linear rail over bumpy terrain. While the importance of limb compliance for stance interactions have been known, our results highlight how limb compliance in the swing-phase can enhance walking performance in naturalistic environments. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

However, the open issues of safety and efficiency have not been systematically addressed for pHRI. In this paper, a new intention-driven variable impedance controller is proposed for compliantly-driven robots, where the robot is controlled to track the estimated human motion intention under a variable desired impedance model. The human motion intention is represented with the desired angle of the human limb and approximated with adaptive neural networks (NNs). Then, the impedance parameters are adjusted online according to the offset between the desired angle and the current joint configuration of the robot. Such a formulation allows the robot to predict human behavior for better collaboration and hence improve the safety and the efficiency of pHRI. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved with Lyapunov methods, and experiments on a lower-limb exoskeleton are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller. © 2021 IEEE.},

In a set of simulation studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational recurrent neural network model. The model is based on the free energy principle such that a pair of interacting robots find themselves in a loop, attempting to predict and infer each other's actions using active inference. We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and interactions. When one robot trained with tighter regulation and another trained with looser regulation interact, the latter tends to lead the interaction by exerting stronger action intention, while the former tends to follow by adapting to its observations. The study confirms that the dyadic imitative interaction becomes successful by achieving a high synchronization rate when a leader and a follower are determined by developing action intentions with strong belief and weak belief, respectively. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Parallel manipulators have the potentials of high efficiency and high precision in the field of machining and manufacturing. However, accuracy improvement of the parallel manipulator is still an essential and challenging issue, encountering two important problems. Firstly, the ignorance of elastic deformation caused by gravity or deviations of static stiffness model restricts further improvement of accuracy. To solve this problem, an elasto-geometrical error modeling method is proposed. The comprehensive effects of structural errors, elastic deformation under gravity and compliance parameter errors on pose deviations are disclosed. On this basis, the identification equation of actual structural errors and compliance parameter errors can be established. Secondly, the ill-conditioned identification matrix and the identification equation with anisotropic residual error can lead to inaccurate identification results. To solve this problem, a weighted regularization method is proposed. The identification equation with isotropic residual error is built, and accurate identification can be realized with the regularization method. Based on the proposed methods, the error compensation experiment is conducted on the prototype of a five-axis parallel machining robot using a laser tracker. Experiment results show that the accuracy of the machining robot is significantly improved after compensation. An M1_160 test piece and an S-shaped test piece are machined and measured to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The elasto-geometrical error modeling method and the weighted regularization method can be applied to other parallel manipulators’ accuracy improvement. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

The controller applies a range of robotic damping from negative to positive values to either inject or dissipate energy based on the user's intent of motion. The controller also estimates the user's intent of direction and applies a variable stiffness torque to stabilize the user towards an estimated ideal trajectory. To evaluate the controller's ability to improve the stability/agility trade-off and reduce human effort, a study was designed for human subjects to perform a 2D target reaching task while coupled with a wearable ankle robot. A constant impedance condition was selected as a control with which to compare the variable impedance condition. The position, speed, and muscle activation responses were used to quantify the user's stability, agility, and effort, respectively. Stability was quantified spatially and temporally, with both overshoot and stabilization time showing no statistically significant difference between the two experimental conditions. Agility was quantified using mean and maximum speed, with both increasing from the constant impedance to variable impedance condition by 29.8% and 59.9%, respectively.

	abstract = {Despite the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, there are many tooling tasks with cognitive aspects that are rather challenging for robots to handle in full autonomy, thus still requiring a certain degree of interaction with a human operator. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for both planning and execution of robot-surface contact tasks whereby interaction with a human operator can be accommodated to a variable degree. The starting point is the geometry of surface, which we assume known and available in a discretized format, e.g. through scanning technologies. To allow for realtime computation, rather than interacting with thousands of vertices, the robot only interacts with a single proxy, i.e. a massless virtual object constrained to ‘live on’ the surface and subject to first order viscous dynamics. The proxy and an impedance-controlled robot are then connected through tuneable and possibly viscoelastic coupling, i.e. (virtual) springs and dampers. On the one hand, the proxy slides along discrete geodesics of the surface in response to both viscoelastic coupling with the robot and to a possible external force (a virtual force which can be used to induce autonomous behaviours). On the other hand, the robot is free to move in 3D in reaction to the same viscoelastic coupling as well as to a possible external force, which includes an actual force exerted by a human operator. The proposed approach is multi-objective in the sense that different operational (autonomous/collaborative) and interactive (for contact/non-contact tasks) modalities can be realized by simply modulating the viscoelastic coupling as well as virtual and physical external forces. We believe that our proposed framework might lead to a more intuitive interfacing to robot programming, as opposed to standard coding. To this end, we also present numerical and experimental studies demonstrating path planning as well as autonomous and collaborative interaction for contact tasks with a free-form surface. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

A novel inference algorithm, based on Bayesian statistics, has been developed. It predicts the most likely 3D target among a predefined set and it also takes into account the possibility that the human drives the robot towards an unknown target. Then, a variable admittance control has also been conceived. It suitably adapts its parameters to establish a directional haptic feedback that helps the human accurately reach the desired goal position. The proposed strategies allow the human to precisely reach the goal even when his/her view is obstructed by the transported object.

	abstract = {Variable admittance control is commonly used for a collaborative robot to achieve the compliant or accurate cooperation according to human’s intention. However, existing research seldom investigates such a human-robot collaboration coupled with an extra environment with unknown stiffness. If the end-effector that is guided by a human with various intended motion contacts the unknown environment, the interaction might become unstable. Additionally, current research for this physical human-robot-environment interaction use two force sensors to address the issue, and hence the cost of the robot is likely to increase and it reduces the flexibility to many applications. Therefore, in this paper, we address the issue of physical human-robot interaction coupled with an extra environment whose stiffness is unknown. To achieve this, the condition of robot admittance is rigorously proved in accordance with different human intended motion and environmental stiffness. Moreover, a variable admittance control scheme is proposed based on human intention, environmental force and environment stiffness using the combination of a force sensor and a force observer. Simulation and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The progressive automation framework allows the seamless transition of a robot from kinesthetic guidance to autonomous operation mode during programming by demonstration of discrete motion tasks. This is achieved by the synergetic action of dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), virtual fixtures, and variable impedance control. The proposed DMPs encode the demonstrated trajectory and synchronize with the current demonstration from the user so that the reference generated motion follows the human's demonstration. The proposed virtual fixtures assist the user in repeating the learned kinematic behavior but allow penetration so that the user can make modifications to the learned trajectory if needed. The tracking error in combination with the interaction forces and torques is used by a variable stiffness strategy to adjust the progressive automation level and transition the leading role between the human and the robot. An energy tank approach is utilized to apply the designed controller and to prove the passivity of the overall control method. An experimental evaluation of the proposed framework is presented for a pick and place task and results show that the transition to autonomous mode is achieved in few demonstrations. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {When agents interact socially with different intentions (or wills), conflicts are difficult to avoid. Although the means by which social agents can resolve such problems autonomously has not been determined, dynamic characteristics of agency may shed light on underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the current study focused on the sense of agency, a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's intention in acting and the outcome, especially in social interaction contexts. Employing predictive coding and active inference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's sense of agency and should have a significant impact on social interactions. To evaluate this hypothesis, we built a computational model of imitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body movement data, which serve as the counterpart in the interactions. A key feature of the model is that the complexity of each modality can be regulated differently by changing the values of a hyperparameter assigned to each local module of the model. We first searched for an optimal setting of hyperparameters that endow the model with appropriate coordination of multimodal sensation. These searches revealed that complexity of the vision module should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception module because of greater uncertainty in visual information flow. Using this optimally trained model as a default model, we investigated how changing the tightness of complexity regulation in the entire network after training affects the strength of the sense of agency during imitative interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation of complexity, an agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other. In contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by adjusting its intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity regulation significantly affects the strength of the sense of agency and the dynamics of interactions between agents in social settings. © Copyright © 2020 Ohata and Tani.},

However, only a selected group of animals, mainly high order mammals such as humans, has passed the mirror test, a behavioural experiment proposed to assess self-recognition abilities. In this paper, we describe self-recognition as a process that is built on top of body perception unconscious mechanisms. We present an algorithm that enables a robot to perform non-appearance self-recognition on a mirror and distinguish its simple actions from other entities, by answering the following question: Am I generating these sensations The algorithm combines active inference, a theoretical model of perception and action in the brain, with neural network learning. The robot learns the relation between its actions and its body with the effect produced in the visual field and its body sensors. The prediction error generated between the models and the real observations during the interaction is used to infer the body configuration through free energy minimization and to accumulate evidence for recognizing its body. Experimental results on a humanoid robot show the reliability of the algorithm for different initial conditions, such as mirror recognition in any perspective, robot-robot distinction and human-robot differentiation. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.},

	abstract = {Snake robots have the potential to maneuver through tightly packed and complex environments. One challenge in enabling them to do so is the complexity in determining how to coordinate their many degrees-of-freedom to create purposeful motion. This is especially true in the types of terrains considered in this work: environments full of unmodeled features that even the best of maps would not capture, motivating us to develop closed-loop controls to react to those features. To accomplish this, this work uses proprioceptive sensing, mainly the force information measured by the snake robot's joints, to react to unmodeled terrain. We introduce a biologically-inspired strategy called directional compliance which modulates the effective stiffness of the robot so that it conforms to the terrain in some directions and resists in others. We present a dynamical system that switches between modes of locomotion to handle situations in which the robot gets wedged or stuck. This approach enables the snake robot to reliably traverse a planar peg array and an outdoor three-dimensional pile of rocks. © 2020 AACC.},

	abstract = {Soft robots and actuators are emerging devices providing more capabilities in the field of robotics. More flexibility and compliance attributing to soft functional materials used in the fabrication of these devices make them ideal for delivering delicate tasks in fragile environments, such as food and biomedical sectors. Yet, the intuitive nonlinearity of soft functional materials and their anisotropic actuation in compliant mechanisms constitute an existent challenge in improving their performance. Topology optimization (TO) along with four-dimensional (4D) printing is a powerful digital tool that can be used to obtain optimal internal architectures for the efficient performance of porous soft actuators. This paper employs TO analysis for achieving high bending deflection of a 3D printed polyelectrolyte actuator, which shows bending deformations in response to electrical stimuli in an electrolyte solution. The performance of the actuator is studied in terms of maximum bending and actuation rate compared with a solid, uniformly 3D printed and topology-optimized actuator. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of TO on achieving higher bending deformation and actuation rate against a uniformly 3D printed actuator. © 2019, The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.},

	abstract = {Collaborative robots should ideally use low torque actuators for passive safety reasons. However, some applications require these collaborative robots to reach deep into confined spaces while assisting a human operator in physically demanding tasks. In this paper, we consider the use of in-situ collaborative robots (ISCRs) that balance the conflicting demands of passive safety dictating low torque actuation and the need to reach into deep confined spaces. We consider the judicious use of bracing as a possible solution to these conflicting demands and present a modeling framework that takes into account the constrained kinematics and the effect of bracing on the endeffector compliance. We then define a redundancy resolution framework that minimizes the directional compliance of the end-effector while maximizing end-effector dexterity. Kinematic simulation results show that the redundancy resolution strategy successfully decreases compliance and improves kinematic conditioning while satisfying the constraints imposed by the bracing task. Applications of this modeling framework can support future research on the choice of bracing locations and support the formation of an admittance control framework for collaborative control of ISCRs under bracing constraints. Such robots can benefit workers in the future by reducing the physiological burdens that contribute to musculoskeletal injury. © 2020 IEEE.},

In the strategy, robots convey its task information to humans and offer groups of guide plans for them to choose, on the premise of maximizing the robot’s own profits. Findings: Compared with traditional negotiation strategies, humans adapt to robots easily and show lower cognitive load in the method, while the satisfied plan shows better performance for the whole human-robot system.

In order to promote the acceptance of cobots, novel interaction paradigms enabling intuitive collaboration between humans and robots are needed. In this work, we propose a variable admittance control framework based on virtual fixtures, in which the damping and the stiffness of the admittance controller are on-line adjusted to increase the effectiveness of the co-manipulation task. Virtual paths are generated to support and guide the operator during collaborative task execution, providing him/her an over-responsive compliant system when the robot is far from the targets and a precise heavy tool in their proximity. The proposed approach has been compared with a fixed admittance controller in an industrial use case consisting of a human operator interacting with a Kuka LBR IIWA arm. The collected results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Emerging trends in neurosciences are providing converging evidence that cortical networks in predominantly motor areas are activated in several contexts related to ‘action’ that do not cause any overt movement. Indeed for any complex body, human or embodied robot inhabiting unstructured environments, the dual processes of shaping motor output during action execution and providing the self with information related to feasibility, consequence and understanding of potential actions (of oneself/others) must seamlessly alternate during goal-oriented behaviors, social interactions. While prominent approaches like Optimal Control, Active Inference converge on the role of forward models, they diverge on the underlying computational basis. In this context, revisiting older ideas from motor control like the Equilibrium Point Hypothesis and synergy formation, this article offers an alternative perspective emphasizing the functional role of a ‘plastic, configurable’ internal representation of the body (body-schema) as a critical link enabling the seamless continuum between motor control and imagery. With the central proposition that both “real and imagined” actions are consequences of an internal simulation process achieved though passive goal-oriented animation of the body schema, the computational/neural basis of muscleless motor synergies (and ensuing simulated actions without movements) is explored. The rationale behind this perspective is articulated in the context of several interdisciplinary studies in motor neurosciences (for example, intracranial depth recordings from the parietal cortex, FMRI studies highlighting a shared cortical basis for action ‘execution, imagination and understanding’), animal cognition (in particular, tool-use and neuro-rehabilitation experiments, revealing how coordinated tools are incorporated as an extension to the body schema) and pertinent challenges towards building cognitive robots that can seamlessly “act, interact, anticipate and understand” in unstructured natural living spaces. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

This system not only can enable automatically motion compensation for the beating heart’s motion as well as non-oscillatory force feedback to the human operators but can also enable training and cooperation for multiple users. A multi-user shared control architecture is developed, and a multilateral impedance-controlled strategy is employed for this architecture. The desired objectives of the proposed system are (a) providing position guidance to the trainees during training procedure, (b) providing force feedback to all human operators (trainer and trainees) regardless of their levels of authority over the slave robot, (c) motion compensation for the heart’s motion, and (d) reflecting only the non-oscillatory force portion of the slave-heart tissue interaction force to all human operators. To this end, virtual fixtures and a dominance factor are introduced, and a reference impedance model with adjusted parameters is designed for each master or slave robot. The proposed impedance-based control methodology is evaluated experimentally.

Compared with traditional methods based on singular perturbation, this method can greatly reduce the computational loads and is more suitable for real-time application. Then, a Cartesian force-feedback path planning combined with Cartesian impedance control based on VDC was used to keep the real contact force within the desired value to protect the manipulator and objects as a force, position, velocity and acceleration sensor, and the sensor can be configured freely by regulating the stiffness, damping and inertia, so the manipulator can interact with human (or unknown environment) in a friendly manner.

This paper proposes a human-robot cooperative control method based on virtual fixture to realize accurate and safe human-robot interaction in endoscopic sinus surgery. Firstly, through endoscopic trajectory analysis, the endoscopic motion constraint requirements of different surgical stages are obtained, and three typical virtual fixtures suitable for endoscopic sinus surgery are designed and implemented. Based on the typical virtual fixtures, a composite virtual fixture is constructed, and then the overall robot motion constraint model is obtained. Secondly, based on the obtained robot motion constraint model, a human-robot cooperative control method based on virtual fixture is proposed. The method adopts admittance control to realize efficient human-robot interaction between the surgeon and robot during the surgery; the virtual fixture is used to restrain and guide the motion of the robot, thereby ensuring motion safety of the robot. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated through a robot-assisted nasal endoscopy experiment, and the result shows that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and safety of operation during endoscopic sinus surgery. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Physical human-robot interaction(pHRI) is the most popular way to ensure the safety in robot surgery. Current research of pHRI in operation room focuses on the inside of the surgical area, which adapts virtual fixtures method for ensuring the safety of drag. But the safety problems caused by human error in the stage of dragging the robot from the outside surgical area to the inside surgical area are ignored. Therefore, a method of applying virtual fixtures to the outside of the surgical area is proposed to solve the safety issues during dragging stage outside surgical area. This method takes the kinematics model of human arm as the reference motion trajectory to construct the guided virtual fixtures, which is to restrict the robot movement in a defined area during the pHRI drag. This drag is based on admittance control method to improve safety and ensure flexibility. Experiment results show that the constructed guided virtual fixtures with the trajectory of the human arm model as the central axis, with radius 30mm, and restrict area 5mm can effectively limit the robot motion to a certain range. Simultaneously, the output speed of the robot in tangent direction of the central axis can well follow the change of the force applied by the doctor, and the output speed in the normal direction of the central axis can converge to zero stably at the pipeline boundary. Consequently, the purpose of improving the safety and flexibility of the surgical robot before surgical operation is realized. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robots have been increasingly used in production line and real life, such as warehousing, logistics, security, smart home and so on. In most applications, localization is always one of the most basic tasks of the robot. To acquire the object location, existing work mainly relies on computer vision. Such methods encounter many problems in practice, such as high computational complexity, large influence by light conditions, and heavy crafting of pre-training. These problems have become one of the key factors that constrains the precise automation of robots. This paper proposes an RFID-based robot navigation and target localization scheme, which is easy to deploy, low cost, and can work in non-line-of-sight scenarios. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. We collect the phase variation of the tag by a rotating reader antenna, and calculate the azimuth of the tag relative to the antenna by the channel similarity weighted average method. Then, the location of the tag is determined by the AoA method. 2. Based on the theory of tag equivalent circuit, antenna radiation field, and cylindrical symmetry oscillator mutual impedance, the phenomenon of RSS weakening of adjacent tags is analyzed. Based on this phenomenon, we achieve accurate target localization and multi-target relative localization by utilizing region segmentation and dynamic time warping algorithms. 3. The proposed scheme is lightweight and low-cost. We built a prototype system using commercial UHF RFID readers and passive tags, and conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that the model can effectively achieve the precise location of the robot and the object with an average error of 27 cm and 2 cm. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.},

It was shown previously that RNNs can be used to effectively infer goal-directed action control policies online. This is achieved by projecting hypothetical environmental interactions dependent on anticipated motor neural activities into the future, back-projecting the discrepancies between predicted and desired future states onto the motor neural activities. Here, we integrate distance signals surrounding a simulated robot flying in a 2D space into this active motor inference process. As a result, local obstacle avoidance emerges in a natural manner. We demonstrate in several experiments with static as well as dynamic obstacle constellations that a simulated flying robot controlled by our RNN-based procedure automatically avoids collisions, while pursuing goal-directed behavior. Moreover, we show that the flight direction dependent regulation of the sensory sensitivity facilitates fast and smooth traversals through tight maze-like environments. In conclusion, it appears that local and global objectives can be integrated seamlessly into RNN-based, model-predictive active inference processes, as long as the objectives do not yield competing gradients. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Control of control moment gyroscopic actuators (CMGs) has been used for regulating the attitude of satellites, ships, vehicles, robots, and even humans for a long time. Generation of directional torques often causes the singularity problem that is strongly dependent on the direction of the momentum vector. Cooperative performances of controlling the magnitude and direction of CMGs can be achieved by both a human operator and a programmed system controller. A human-actuator collaborative control framework for CMGs is proposed by introducing a novel frequency-division control technique, which controls the magnitude and the direction of the torque separately in the frequency domain. The magnitude is controlled by the programmed system controller in the high frequency and the direction is controlled by a human operator in the low frequency. To realize such a frequency-division collaboration method between an actuator and a human operator, two CMGs are developed, and one is collaboratively controlled by another CMG manipulated by a human operator like a haptic device. The goal is to manipulate the direction of the momentum by transferring human inputs to the CMG. Defining impedance models of both actuators forms the bilateral transformation matrix that provides haptic and manipulation capabilities. The proposed method is verified through the experimental studies of two CMGs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

A highly articulated helical interface is 3-D-printed with thermoactive functionally graded joints using a conventional 3-D printing device that utilizes UV curable acrylic plastic and hydroxylated wax as the primary and supporting material. The joint compliance is controlled by regulating wax temperature in phase transition. Empirical feed-forward control relations are identified through comprehensive study of the wax melting profile and actuation scenarios for different shaft designs to achieve desirable repeatability and response time. A decentralized control approach is employed by relating the mathematical terms of the Cosserat beam method to their morphological counterparts in which the manipulator local anisotropic stiffness is controlled based on the local stress and strain information. As a result, a minimalistic central controller is designed in which the joints' thermomechanical states are observed using a morphological observer, an external fully monitored replica of the observed system with the same inputs. Preliminary results for passive shape adaptation, geometrical disturbance rejection, and task space anisotropic stiffness control are reported by integrating the interface on a continuum manipulator. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Remote actuation is useful in human-interacting robots to reduce dynamic loading on distal joints. Cable-conduit transmissions, sometimes referred to as Bowden cable or tendon-sheath actuation, are a lightweight option for transferring power to a distal joint from a remotely located actuator. However, the nature of such transmissions causes the system to suffer from diminished efficiency and high reflected impedance as a result of distributed frictional effects between cable and conduit. A dynamic model is useful to produce controllers capable of accurately tracking force or displacement at the system's output. In this paper, we present a new computational model for cable-conduit systems that describes interaction with non-passive environments. Unlike previous models, our model features bi-directional propagation of motion within the cable-conduit system. This allows for simulation of human-interacting systems where both the human and the robot have the capability to impose motion or force. Because of this feature, the developed model is applicable to a wide range of physical systems. The model is validated in a physical prototype through experiments involving physical interaction with a human subject. We show that our model accurately predicts behaviors observed in the experimental system. © 2018 IEEE.},

To create energy-efficient and low-noise underwater robots, it is necessary to create methods for influencing the structure of wall currents and the shape of the aerodynamic surfaces of the robot in order to reduce its surface friction, as well as impedance. In this paper, we consider the development of an experimental bench for testing the main executive systems of an underwater robot with an anisotropic hull, including a buoyancy variation system, a trim and roll change system, and a hull geometry changing system. © 2016},

	abstract = {Cooperation between surgeon and robot is one of the key technologies that limit the robot to be widely used in orthopedic clinics. In this study, the evolution of human-robot cooperation methods and the control strategies for typical human-robot cooperation in robot-assisted orthopedics surgery were reviewed at first. Then an intelligent admittance control method, which combines the fuzzy model reference learning control with the virtual constraint control, is proposed to solve the requirements of intuitive human-robot interaction during orthopedics surgery. That is, a variable damping parameter model of the admittance control based on fuzzy model learning control algorithm is introduced to make the robot move freely by using the reference model of surgeon’s motion equation with the minimum jerk trajectory. And the virtual constraint control method based on the principle of virtual fixture is adopted to make the robot move within the pre-defined area so as to perform more safe surgery. The basic principle and its realization of this intelligent control method are described in details. At last, a test platform is built based on our designed 6 DOF articulated robot. Experiments of safety and precision on acrylic model with this method show that the robot has the ability of better intuitive interaction and the high precision. And the pilot experiment of bone tumor resection on sawbone model shows the effectiveness of this method. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel semi-autonomous shared control framework based on an admittance configured haptic interface for bilateral teleoperation of VTOL aerial robots. A haptics-aided path planner and a virtual fixture based dynamic kinesthetic boundary (VFDKB) are proposed to better assist pilots to navigate through complex environments and perceive obstacle and path boundary. By combining the autonomous path planner and VFDKB, the novel framework maximizes autonomy and maintains flexibility to allow pilots to freely fly the robot with minimal effort for navigation and obstacle avoidance. The RRT based path planner uses the human operator's force input to dynamically determine the target position and heuristically bias the sampling process for better efficiency in finding a collision-free path. Cost functions are used to assess the difference between goal positions and generated paths for determining the replanning process and distance-optimal path. A virtual fixture based dynamic kinesthetic boundary prioritizes the haptic cue of more critical information between obstacles and path guidance virtual fixture (GVF) for pilot to achieve safe navigation. The theoretical analysis provides proof for guaranteed obstacle avoidance performance of the novel approach. Simulation and experimental study on an aerial robotic platform were conducted, and the outcomes confirm our claims. © 2016 TCCT.},

	abstract = {Robotic systems are increasingly relying on distributed feedback controllers to tackle complex sensing and decision problems, such as those found in highly articulated human-centered robots. These demands come at the cost of a growing computational burden and, as a result, larger controller latencies. To maximize robustness to mechanical disturbances by maximizing control feedback gains, this paper emphasizes the necessity for compromise between high-and low-level feedback control efforts in distributed controllers. Specifically, the effect of distributed impedance controllers is studied, where damping feedback effort is executed in close proximity to the control plant and stiffness feedback effort is executed in a latency-prone centralized control process. A central observation is that the stability of high-impedance distributed controllers is very sensitive to damping feedback delay but much less to stiffness feedback delay. This study pursues a detailed analysis of this observation that leads to a physical understanding of the disparity. Then, a practical controller breakdown gain rule is derived to aim at enabling control designers to consider the benefits of implementing their control applications in a distributed fashion. These considerations are further validated through the analysis, simulation, and experimental testing on high-performance actuators and on an omnidirectional mobile base. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an omni-directional walking-aid robot is developed to assist the elderly in the daily living movements. A motion control strategy of walking-aid robot based on the observation of the human status through wearable sensors is proposed. During normal walking, the robot is controlled using a conventional admittance control scheme. When the tendency of a fall is detected, the robot will immediately react to prevent the user from falling down. The distance between the human Center of Pressure (COP) and the midpoint of the human feet is assumed to be a significant feature to detecting the fall events. When the user is in a quasi-static state or walking slowly, the COP can be approximated by the projection of Center of Gravity (COG) of the user's body. A simple and low-cost wearable sensor system is proposed to measure online the COG of the user. A limitation of the proposed wearable sensor system is that the Head-Arms-Torso (HAT) of the user is assumed to be always in upright position, which may generate measurement error. From comparison experiments with a reference optical system it is found that the measurement error is acceptable especially at the early stage of fall event. Dubois possibility theory is applied to describe the membership function of "normal walking" state. A threshold based fall detection approach is obtained from online evaluation of the walking status. Finally, experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Compliant human-robot interaction is necessary for the seamless integration of robotic devices into everyday life. Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a potential interface for compliant control due to the natural relationship between muscle activity and joint stiffness. Previous works have used sEMG to predict and control impedance along a single degree-of-freedom (DOF). However, humans interacting in unstable environments tune both the magnitude and direction of their impedance. This paper proposes a framework for multi-directional impedance control with sEMG to enhance compliant interactions. The framework allows subjects to simultaneously control both the direction of motion and primary stiffness axis of a robot, enabling stable behavior with controlled compliance to external forces. The efficacy of the approach is shown in a five day experiment with a 3-DOF virtual environment. Subjects displayed significant performance enhancements consistent with motor skill learning as they learned to follow paths and stay at desired targets while compensating for external forces. The framework is also demonstrated with compliant simultaneous and proportional control of a robot arm, suggesting the approach as a natural interface for enhancing capabilities of compliant human-robot interaction. © 2015 IEEE.},

Recently, there has been a lot of progress in adaptive impedance and admittance control for human-robot interaction. Not as many contributions have been reported on online adaptation schemes that can accommodate users with varying physical strength and skill level during interaction with a robot. The goal of this paper is to present and evaluate a novel adaptive admittance controller that can incorporate human intent, nominal task models, as well as variations in the robot dynamics. An outer-loop controller is developed using an ARMA model which is tuned using an adaptive inverse control technique. An inner-loop neuroadaptive controller linearizes the robot dynamics. Working in conjunction and online, this two-loop technique offers an elegant way to decouple the pHRI problem. Experimental results are presented comparing the performance of different types of admittance controllers. The results show that efficient online adaptation of the robot admittance model for different human subjects can be achieved. Specifically, the adaptive admittance controller reduces jerk which results in a smooth human-robot interaction. © 2015 IEEE.},

We study airbrush painting because it resembles in many ways manual welding, a standard industrial task. The experiments are performed with the 7 degrees of freedom KUKA lightweight robot arm. The robot is controlled in admittance using a force sensor attached at the end-point, so as to act as a free-mass and be passively guided by the human. For impedance measurements, a set of nine subjects perform 12 repetitions of airbrush painting, drawing a straight-line on a cartoon horizontally placed on a table, while passively moving the airbrush mounted on the robot's end-point. We measure hand impedance during the painting task by generating sudden and brief external forces with the robot. The results show that on average the dominant hand displays larger impedance than the nondominant in the directions perpendicular to the painting line. We find the most significant difference in the damping values in these directions. Based on this observation, we develop a "directional damping" scheme for robotic assistance and conduct a pilot study with 12 subjects to contrast airbrush painting with and without robotic assistance. Results show significant improvement in precision with both dominant and nondominant hands when using robotic assistance. © 2014 IEEE.},

The robot consists of a stick, a group of sensors and an omni-directional basis driven by three Swedish wheels. Multiple sensors were used to recognize the user’s “walking intention”, which is quantitatively described by a new concept called intentional direction (ITD). Based on the guidance of filtered ITD, a novel intentionbased admittance motion control (IBAC) scheme was proposed for the cane robot. The experiment results demonstrated that the user feels more natural and comfortable when walking with the assistance of cane robot controlled by the IBAC strategy. To detect the fall of user, a detection method based on Dubois possibility theory was proposed using the combined sensor information from force sensors and a laser ranger finder (LRF) fixed on the cane robot. The human fall model was represented in a two-dimensional space, where the relative position between the Zero- Moment-Point (ZMP) and the center of support triangle was utilized as a significant feature.

The latter requires the human to control the dynamic characteristics of the upper limb musculoskeletal system. These characteristics are quantitatively represented by inertia, damping, and stiffness, which are measures of mechanical impedance. Many previous studies have shown that arm posture is a dominant factor in determining the end point impedance on a horizontal plane. This paper presents the characterization of the end point impedance of the human arm in 3-D space. Moreover, it models the regulation of the arm impedance with muscle cocontraction. The characterization is made by route of experimental trials where human subjects maintained arm posture while their arms were perturbed by a robot arm. Furthermore, the subjects were asked to control the level of their arm muscles' cocontraction, using visual feedback, in order to investigate the effect of muscle cocontraction on the arm impedance. The results of this study show an anisotropic increase of arm stiffness due to muscle cocontraction. These results could improve our understanding of the human arm biomechanics, as well as provide implications for human motor control - specifically the control of arm impedance through muscle cocontraction. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robotic systems have the potential to assist vitre-oretinal surgeons in extremely difficult surgical tasks inside the human eye. In addition to reducing hand tremor and improving tool positioning, a robotic assistant can provide assistive motion guidance using virtual fixtures, and incorporate real-time feedback from intraocular force sensing ophthalmic instruments to present tissue manipulation forces, that are otherwise physically imperceptible to the surgeon. This paper presents the design of an FBG-based, multi-function instrument that is capable of measuring mN-level forces at the instrument tip located inside the eye, and also the sclera contact location on the instrument shaft and the corresponding contact force. The given information is used to augment cooperatively controlled robot behavior with variable admittance control. This effectively creates an adaptive remote center-of-motion (RCM) constraint to minimize eye motion, but also allows the translation of the RCM location if the instrument is not near the retina. In addition, it provides force scaling for sclera force feedback. The calibration and validation of the multifunction force sensing instrument are presented, along with demonstration and performance assessment of the variable admittance robot control on an eye phantom. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: In a deforming anatomic environment, the motion of an instrument suffers from complex geometrical and dynamic constraints, robot assisted minimally invasive surgery therefore requires more sophisticated skills for surgeons. This paper proposes a novel dynamic virtual fixture (DVF) to enhance the surgical operation accuracy of admittance-type medical robotics in the deforming environment.Methods: A framework for DVF on the Euclidean Group SE(3) is presented, which unites rotation and translation in a compact form. First, we constructed the holonomic/non-holonomic constraints, and then searched for the corresponded reference to make a distinction between preferred and non-preferred directions. Second, different control strategies are employed to deal with the tasks along the distinguished directions. The desired spatial compliance matrix is synthesized from an allowable motion screw set to filter out the task unrelated components from manual input, the operator has complete control over the preferred directions; while the relative motion between the surgical instrument and the anatomy structures is actively tracked and cancelled, the deviation relative to the reference is compensated jointly by the operator and DVF controllers. The operator, haptic device, admittance-type proxy and virtual deforming environment are involved in a hardware-in-the-loop experiment, human-robot cooperation with the assistance of DVF controller is carried out on a deforming sphere to simulate beating heart surgery, performance of the proposed DVF on admittance-type proxy is evaluated, and both human factors and control parameters are analyzed.Results: The DVF can improve the dynamic properties of human-robot cooperation in a low-frequency (0 ~ 40 rad/sec) deforming environment, and maintain synergy of orientation and translation during the operation. Statistical analysis reveals that the operator has intuitive control over the preferred directions, human and the DVF controller jointly control the motion along the non-preferred directions, the target deformation is tracked actively.Conclusions: The proposed DVF for an admittance-type manipulator is capable of assisting the operator to deal with skilled operations in a deforming environment. © 2014 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The robot consists of a stick, a group of sensors and an omni-directional basis driven by three Swedish wheels. Multiple sensors were used to recognize the user's 'walking intention', which is quantitatively described by a new concept called intentional direction (ITD). Based on the guidance of filtered ITD, a novel intention-based admittance motion control (IBAC) scheme was proposed for the cane robot. To detect the fall of user, a detection method based on Dubois possibility theory was proposed using the combined sensor information from force sensors, a laser ranger finder (LRF) and an on-shoe load sensor. The human fall model was represented in a two-dimensional space, where the relative position between the center of pressure (COP) and the center of support triangle was utilized as a significant feature. The effectiveness of proposed fall detection method was also confirmed by experiments. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the near future, humans and robots are expected to perform collaborative tasks involving physical interaction in various different environments such as homes, hospitals, and factories. One important research topic in physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) is to develop tacit and natural haptic communication between the partners. Although there are already several studies in the area of Human-Robot Interaction, the number of studies investigating the physical interaction between the partners and in particular the haptic communication are limited and the interaction in such systems is still artificial when compared to natural human-human collaboration. Although the tasks involving physical interaction such as the table transportation can be planned and executed naturally and intuitively by two humans, there are unfortunately no robots in the market that can collaborate and perform the same tasks with us. In this study, we propose a new controller for the robotic partner that is designed to a) detect the intentions of the human partner through haptic channel using a fuzzy controller b) adjust its contribution to the task via a variable impedance controller and c) resolve the conflicts during the task execution by controlling the internal forces. The results of the simulations performed in Simulink/Matlab show that the proposed controller is superior to the stand-alone standard/variable impedance controllers.},

The active constraint controller monitors the robotic manipulator with respect to the environment and task, and anisotropically regulates the motion to provide assistance. The type of assistance offered by active constraints can vary, but they are typically used to either guide the user along a task-specific pathway or limit the user to within a "safe" region. There are several diverse methods described within the literature for applying active constraints, and these are surveyed within this paper. The active constraint research is described and compared using a simple generalized framework, which consists of three primary processes: 1) constraint definition, 2) constraint evaluation, and 3) constraint enforcement. All relevant research approaches for each of these processes, found using search terms associated to "virtual fixture, " "active constraint" and 'motion constraint,' are presented. © 2013 IEEE.},

A motion control strategy of walking-aid robot based on observing human status by wearable sensors is proposed. During normal walking, the robot is controlled by a conventional admittance control scheme. When the tendency of a fall is detected, the robot will immediately react to prevent the user from falling down. The distance between the human Centre of Pressure (COP) and the midpoint of two human feet is assumed to be a significant feature to detecting the fall events. Dubois possibility theory is applied to describe the membership function of 'normal walking' state. A threshold based fall detection approach is obtained from online evaluation of the walking status.

The virtual fi xtures are obtained directly from the surgical planner with the purpose of increasing the precision in screw insertion and having safer interventions, reducing radiation doses, invasiveness and the probability of error.

The prototype uses a PA-10 robotic arm. The main parts of the control strategy are the admittance module and the generation of virtual fixtures (active constraints) that assist the surgeon and prevents contact with surrounding critical areas. The virtual fixtures are obtained directly from the surgical plan with the purpose of increasing the precision in screw insertion and having safer interventions, reducing radiation doses, invasiveness and the probability of error. Differing from other surgery robotic assistants, the one proposed in this work offers a larger workspace and a degree of versatility that permits its adaptation to different types of surgeries. © 2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we introduce methods to improve the base performance of the Active Handrest's linear admittance controller (V = K <inf>a</inf> * F) based on knowledge of user intention, through adaptive admittance, and knowledge of the environment, via virtual fixtures. Herein, we present feasibility studies to apply adaptive admittance and virtual fixtures to the motion of the Active Handrest and measure user performance. We introduce a more relevant evaluation task for the Active Handrest by conducting experiments involving the navigation of virtual labyrinths. The results of these experiments show that adaptive admittance improves a user's ability to accurately navigate a narrow labyrinth, with less cost of time than using constant gains with a linear admittance controller. Additionally, a feasibility study on virtual fixtures shows that user performance for drawing straight lines with virtual fixtures applied directly to the Active Handrest is equivalent to user performance with virtual fixtures applied directly to the grasped tool, as has been done more traditionally. These results underscore the utility of the Active Handrest as they show the potential to achieve highly accurate motions without the need for a robotically enabled or co-manipulated tool. © 2012 IEEE.},

The objective of this robot is to enable various internal and external transitions which are very challenging tasks for previously developed climbing robots. Realizing the transitions by an using under-actuated system without complex control is another contribution of this research. The robot is driven using a tread-wheel mechanism made of a flat sticky polymer to realize fast and robust climbing. Directional compliant joints are used between the two modules to increase the preload on each front wheel. An active tail is used at the end of the second module to compensate for the negative effects of the compliant joint forces. This combination of directional compliant joints and active tail also allows the robot to perform various internal and external transitions passively. The induced positive preload on the front wheels are analyzed and verified. Three types of internal transition and three types of external transition including a thin-wall transition are achieved by the robot prototype. The concept of the directional compliance with the active tail can be adopted to other climbing robots to enhance robustness and mobility. © 2011 IEEE.},

Guided by the online estimated ITD, we apply the admittance control method in the motion control of cane robot. The gravity compensation is also considered because the user is possible to walk on a slope. For the abnormal walking, we mainly studied the case of user's falling down. The Center of Gravity (COG) of user can be estimated from the angle of an inverted pendulum which represents human model.

	abstract = {Quantitative characterization of ankle mechanical impedance is important to understand how the ankle supports lower-extremity functions during interaction with the environment. This paper reports a novel procedure to characterize static multivariable ankle mechanical impedance. An experimental protocol using a wearable therapeutic robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable measurement of torque and angle data in multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously, a combination of inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion. The measured multivariable torque-angle relation was represented as a vector field, and approximated using a method based on thin-plate spline smoothing with generalized cross validation. The vector field enabled assessment of several important characteristics of static ankle mechanical impedance, which are not available from prior single degree of freedom studies: the directional variation of ankle mechanical impedance, the extent to which the ankle behaves as a spring, and evidence of uniquely neural contributions. The method was validated by testing a simple physical "mock-up" consisting of passive elements. Experiments with young unimpaired subjects quantified the behavior of the maximally relaxed human ankle, showing that ankle mechanical impedance is spring-like but strongly direction-dependent, being weakest in inversion. Remarkably, the analysis was sufficiently sensitive to detect a subtle but statistically significant deviation from spring-like behavior if subjects were not fully relaxed. This method may provide new insight about the function of the ankle, both unimpaired and after biomechanical or neurological injury. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Voluntary muscle activation has a significant impact on ankle impedance, increasing it by up to a factor of three in our experiments. Furthermore, significant asymmetries and deviations from a linear two-spring model are present in many subjects, indicating that ankle impedance has a complex and individually idiosyncratic structure.

However, QM principles aid the understanding of any unusual property at the nanotech level. The other major difference between nano-photonics and other forms of optics is that the nano-scale is not very 'hands on'. For the most part, we will not be able to see the components with our naked eyes, but will be required to use some nanotech imaging tools, as follows: (1) Electron Scanning Microscope (through a focusing lens of positive refractive index material). (2) Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM, (de Broglie Wave for dry metallic materials). (3) X-ray Laser Photons: Specifically, Los Alamos Lab has produced the world record for the shortest wavelength X-ray laser for coherent imaging of atoms. (4) Nature photonics is an inspiration, a proof of existence in nano-scales: e.g. reflection-free glare-less Moth'fs eye, dirt-free lily flower emerging from a muddy pond, sucking setae of scalping gecko, etc. (5) Evanescence Wave Imaging: the detail evanescence decaying waves become a propagating imaging focusing wave in case of a negative dielectric constant, such as made possible at the anisotropic dielectric material which might produce a negative transversal index ε<inf>⊥</inf> <sup>2</sup>=∥ε<inf>o</inf>∥<sup>2</sup>- ε<inf>∥</inf><sup>2</sup>; or the optical surface optical Plasmon reactive interaction, or man-made slit ring :"letter C" at the long-long infrared at hundreds THz complex impedance.

This manipulator is augmented with the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), after a detailed blue-print made by STM imaging. As an application, we review (i) a simple self-consistency derivation of the Wallance'fs band-gap formulae for Single Wall CNT; (ii) the prototype of non-cryogenic dual infrared spectrum cameras made of the semiconductor Carbon NanoTube (CNT), and (iii) the high efficient solar voltaic cells made of a stack of rotated staircase of CNT'fs. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

We consider the characteristics of the servo brakes and control the brake torque of each wheel based on the brake force/moment constraint so that several motion functions of PRP are realized based on the applied force. This allows PRP to track a path which includes motion perpendicular to the pushing direction of the human without using servo motors. The impedance-based motion control is also realized with respect to the perpendicular to the pushing direction.

The robot compliance here refers to the structural elastic deformation of the device. The high mechanical stiffness and non-backdrivability of a typical admittance-controlled robot allow for slow and precise motions, making it highly suitable for tasks that require accuracy near human physical limits, such as microsurgery. However, previous experiments have shown that even small robot compliance degraded virtual fixture performance, especially at the micro scale. In this work, control methods to minimize the effect of robot compliance on virtual fixture performance were developed for admittance-controlled cooperative systems. Based on a linear model of the robot dynamics, we applied a Kalman filter to integrate the measurements obtained from the camera and encoders to estimate the robot end-effector position. A partitioned control law was used to achieve end-effector trajectory following on the desired velocity commanded by the admittance and virtual fixture control laws. The effectiveness of the Kalman filter and the controller was validated on a one degree-of-freedom admittance-controlled cooperative testbed. ©2008 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With few exceptions, most of the existing noise reduction and data segmentation algorithms are only suited to image data. Therefore, an adaptive smoothing algorithm, with model-based masks, within a scale space framework is proposed for range data in this paper. This algorithm smoothes range data that conform to predefined, geometric models, while leaving other data points unaffected. The convergence of the algorithm in yielding dominant features is shown based on its compliance with the anisotropic diffusion concept. The weights of the smoothing masks are adaptively calculated according to the Mahalanobis distances between range data and model-based predictions. These behave as the diffusion coefficient in the anisotropic diffusion equation, thus satisfying the requirements of the causality criterion that no new features are introduced from fine to coarse scales. The computational complexity of this algorithm is examined and compared to that of the well-known RANSAC feature extraction algorithm. Unlike RANSAC, it has the advantage that the computational complexity is less affected by increasing the order of the model, and is independent of the number of model outliers. The proposed algorithm can be used to smooth range data in multiscale space by increasing the number of smoothing iterations. Robust, robot-occlusion-invariant features are then easily extracted from the smoothed data by least squares fitting algorithms. © 2008 IEEE.},

We analyze the singularity of PRP braking torques, and control the brake torque of each wheel based on the brake force/moment constraint so that impedance characteristics is realized on PRP with human's pushing. This allows a PRP to track a 2D path which includes motion perpendicular to human's pushing direction without using servo motors, and multi-PRPs to work cooperatively on handling a single object with orientation control for avoiding collision with obstacles. Experimental results are shown to illustrate the validity of the proposed concept. © 2007 IEEE.},

A desired path is obtained using computer vision, and virtual fixtures for assistance in planar path following were implemented on an admittance-controlled robot. The admittance controller uses a velocity gain, so that the speed of the robot is proportional to the force applied by the operator. The level of virtual fixture guidance is determined by the admittance ratio, which is the ratio of the admittance gain of the force components orthogonal to the path to the gain of the force components parallel to the path. In Experiment 1, we found a linear relationship between admittance ratio and performance. In Experiment 2, we examined the effect of admittance ratio on the performance of three tasks: path following, off-path targeting, and obstacle avoidance. An algorithm was developed to select an appropriate admittance ratio based on the nature of the task. Automatic admittance ratio tuning is recommended for next-generation virtual fixtures.
