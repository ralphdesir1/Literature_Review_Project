	abstract = {Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) systems equipped with compliant admittance controllers typically utilize F/T sensors to capture the forces applied by the operator. However, the impedance force feedback generated by the robot's motion and the impedance of the human hand can significantly distort the intentional forces. This distortion can lead to vibrations that compromise both interaction transparency and stability. To address this issue, we propose a variable admittance control strategy that incorporates an Interaction Intention Filter (IIF) and an Enhanced Time-Domain Vibration Observer (ETDVO). We first introduce the concept of the IIF, which is designed based on a frequency-domain analysis of force signals collected from real-world human–robot cooperation tasks. This filter effectively prevents unintended impedance force feedback from being transmitted to the admittance controller. Moreover, to ensure interaction stability across diverse environments, we propose a variable-width time window-based ETDVO for accurately computing the vibration index. By leveraging this index, we introduce a variable admittance control strategy based on exponential mapping, which enables rapid adjustment of the admittance parameters, effectively suppresses vibrations and enhances stability. Finally, the proposed strategy is validated through human–robot cooperative laser tracking experiments conducted on a 7-DoF manipulator. Statistical results from the experiments demonstrate that our approach not only improves interaction transparency but also significantly enhances overall stability. Compared to the stable high-gain admittance controller, the Task Time, Required Energy, and Mean Force are reduced by over 10%, 54%, 58%, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the complex contour of customized physical interfaces brings challenges in integrating sensors. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for sensorizing the interfaces based on a 3D-printed Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) pressure sensor, which is easy to customize, regardless of the complexity of the spatial working surfaces of the interface. Considering the anisotropic conductivity of 3D-printed parts, we first investigated its properties and examined its impact on EIT imaging using simple shape 2D planar sensors. Then, an adjusted Jacobian matrix was employed in imaging to reduce the impact of anisotropic conductivity on imaging. Finally, an EIT pressure sensor embedded physical interface was customized for the forearm using 3D printing and tested on a rehabilitation cobot. The online experimental results validated that it can effectively monitor the distribution and variation of pressure between the human body and the interface. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Robots in uncertain realworld environments must perform both goaldirected and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Six-Degree-of-Freedom (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation tasks, especially in human-robot collaboration environments. Recently, 6D pose estimation has been extended from seen objects to novel objects due to the frequent encounters with unfamiliar items in real-life scenarios. This paper presents a three-stage pipeline for 6D pose estimation of previously unseen objects, leveraging the capabilities of large vision-language models. Our approach consists of vision-language model-based object detection and segmentation, mask selection with pose hypothesis generated from CAD models, and refinement and scoring of pose candidates. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art Average Recall (AR) score of 75.8 with RGB-D images, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately estimating 6D poses for a diverse range of objects. The effectiveness of each operation stage is investigated in the ablation study. To validate the practical applicability of our approach, we conduct case studies on a real-world robotic platform, focusing on object pick-up tasks by integrating our 6D pose estimation pipeline with human intention prediction and task analysis algorithms. Results show that the proposed method can effectively handle novel objects in our test environments, as demonstrated through the YCB dataset evaluation and case studies. Our work contributes to the field of human-robot collaboration by introducing a flexible, generalizable approach to 6D pose estimation, enabling robots to adapt to new objects without requiring extensive retraining—a vital capability for advancing human-robot collaboration in dynamic environments.

	abstract = {The human hand's exceptional dexterity and compliance, derived from its rigid-soft coupling structure and tendon-driven interphalangeal coordination, inspire robotic grippers capable of versatile grasping and force adaptation. Traditional rigid manipulators lack compliance for delicate tasks, while soft robots often suffer from instability and low load capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose a biomimetic multi-joint composite finger integrating a 3D-printed rigid phalanges (46-51 mm) with dual fabric-reinforced pneumatic bladders, mimicking human finger biomechanics. This hybrid design combines hinge-jointed rigidity and anisotropic fabric constraints, enabling two rotational degrees of freedom with higher radial stiffness, achieving 2.18× higher critical burst pressure (240 kPa) than non-reinforced bladders, while preserving axial compliance. Experimental validation demonstrates a 4.77 N maximum fingertip force at 200 kPa and rapid recovery (< 2s) post-impact. The composite finger exhibits human-like gestures (enveloping, pinching, flipping) and adapts to irregular/fragile objects (e.g., eggs, screws) through coordinated bladder actuation. Assembled into a modular gripper, it sustains 1 kg payloads and executes thin-object flipping via proximal-distal joint synergy. This rigid-soft coupling design bridges compliance and robustness, offering high environmental adaptability for applications in industrial automation, human-robot interaction, and delicate manipulation. © The Author(s), 2025.

Among various active pillar structures, liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) pillar arrays are capable of exhibiting significant and reversible anisotropic deformation under cyclic heating and cooling, showing great potential in tunable adhesion, soft robots, and biomedical devices. However, scaling up LCE pillar manufacturing remains challenging, limiting its practical applications. In this work, a solvent-free LCE resin is developed with unique features including simple operating procedure, short fabrication time, and tunable responsive temperature, enabling rapid and large-scale production of LCE pillar arrays. The LCE resin allows for the preparation of complex 3D shapes in addition to film or specimen. The fabrication time can be as short as 4 h, without the need to evaporate solvent. Moreover, the LCE resins can be adjusted with a variable phase transition temperature range from 49.4 °C to 97.7 °C by incorporating non-liquid crystal acrylate chains. The resulting active pillar array structure can undertake sequential actuation upon heating with the tunable actuation temperature. Finally, the application of these pillar arrays in multi-level information encryption is demonstrated. The LCE pillar structure introduced here offers a new strategy for constructing advanced active LCE structures with tunable responsive behavior. © Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences 2025.},

	abstract = {Admittance control is a widely used approach for ensuring compliant robot behavior in physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) tasks. The selection of admittance parameters is crucial, as it directly affects interaction stability. However, this process becomes challenging when the robot's interaction with objects involves not only the human hand but also the task environment. This is because the task environment is often unknown and hard to predict while the models of the human hand have been extensively studied in previous work. To address this issue, this paper proposes an admittance adaptive algorithm that ensures stability in human–robot-environment interaction tasks. This algorithm can adjust damping online without prior information about environments. Specifically, we consider the coupling between the robot, human hand, and task environment, treating them as a whole to analyze interaction stability and construct an energy function. Then, based on the energy function, a passive observer is designed to monitor unstable behaviors during the interaction process. Finally, the algorithm adjusts the damping online based on the observed values. The algorithm was experimentally validated using a custom admittance force feedback device. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm can ensure interaction stability without prior information about environments. In the experiment of writing letters, compared to a constant-parameter admittance controller, the algorithm reduces operator effort while maintaining stability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference – either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control – inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents. We start from a simple unit and gradually describe more advanced structures, comparing recently proposed design choices and providing basic examples. This study distances itself from traditional views centered on neural networks and reinforcement learning, and points toward a yet unexplored direction in active inference: hybrid representations in hierarchical models. © 2025 The Authors},

The literature has extensively addressed the ethical issues related to SAR, especially concerning trust and justification in the choices and actions made by the robotic agent towards the user and the external environment. However, it is worth considering at a deeper level the technical implementation of DM. Models of AIF recently have been considered attractive for implementing explainable artificial intelligence for DM, with potentially groundbreaking implications for robotics. Indeed, AIF is particularly effective for complex tasks where the dynamics of the robot are uncertain, as these occur in human-robot interaction, and especially in SAR. This contribution tries to provide an encompassing account of the ethical implications of DM for SAR, by focusing on the often overlooked issue of the ethics of technical implementation. We first present the topic of DM for SAR, then discuss relevant ethical implications, and in a third step present the AIF model for DM and its applications in robotics.

	abstract = {This paper presents a biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance controller designed to enhance the performance of coupled human–robot systems during motion. The controller integrates the biomechanical characteristics of human limbs and dynamically adjusts the robotic impedance parameters—specifically damping, stiffness, and equilibrium trajectory—based on real-time estimations of the user's intent and direction of motion. The primary goal is to minimize the energy expenditure of the coupled human–robot system while maintaining system passivity. To address uncertainties in human behavior and noisy observations, the controller employs Bayesian optimization combined with a Gaussian process. To validate the proposed approach, human experiments are conducted using a standard robotic arm manipulator. The results demonstrate that the controller eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, a process that is typically time-consuming. A comparative analysis against two variable impedance controllers without user-adaptive parameter adjustments reveal significant benefits, with the controller improving combined performance metrics—such as accuracy, speed, user effort, and smoothness—by over 13%. Notably, all participants in the study preferred the optimized controller over the alternatives.

	abstract = {Soft robots hold interaction compliance and safety over rigid-body robots for promising adaptation and unique motion modes in unstructured environments, but weak payload due to the inherent compliance limits the task execution. Enhancing the payload for the classic pneumatic soft actuator remains a challenge, with the physical limitation of negative pressure supply less than 1 atm and buckling of thin-walled body. Previous works focused more on single-chamber structural promotion, such as stacking, directional constraint, and novel configuration design, while they could not completely avoid the abovementioned physical limitation. In this work, we proposed the nested dual-chamber origami actuator by integrating the Yoshimura origami with pleated origami to generate bidirectional motion via compounding of positive and negative pressure actuation within different chambers. Through the all-time intervention of the positive pressure, the proposed actuator enables enhancing bidirectional payload, especially in contraction. The design and fabrication are analyzed to prototype, and the statics models are derived to reveal the relationship between the pressure compounding and output force with the experimental validation. The experimental results show that the nested actuator can initially improve by 12.5% payload by the structural assembly while achieving even 162% payload enhancement in the contraction process through dual-chamber pneumatic compounding, compared to the common single-chamber Yoshimura actuator without diminishing the payload performance in the elongation direction at the same time. This nested design offers a novel approach to enhancing payload of soft actuators and has the potential to be further expanded into other motion forms. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.},

	abstract = {Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic: How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns? To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference on the basis of the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced substantially by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuomotor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience. copyright © 2025 the authors, some rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The current study investigated possible human-robot kinaesthetic interactions using a variational recurrent neural network (RNN) model, called PV-RNN, which is based on the free-energy principle. Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between the top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy. The current study examines how changing the meta-prior w in the interaction phase affects the counter force generated when an experimenter attempts to induce movement pattern transitions familiar to the robot through its prior training. The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Finally, the study examines how different levels of disturbances, pattern level, and cognitive level can be resolved internally across different layers. Our experimental results indicated that 1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when w is set with larger/smaller values; 2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions; and 3) when the robot was disturbed in the cognitive level, the disturbance was resolved more in the higher layer as compared to the case with disturbance in the pattern level. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in action intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them. © 2013 IEEE.},

Based on these findings, a scheme was proposed in this article to integrate the linear quadratic estimation (LQE) filter with the stiffness model inferred from grasp force, which can simultaneously estimate the human arm's stiffness and motion intention. Then, an online variable impedance controller (VIC) was designed based on these estimations for physical human–robot interaction (pHRI). The proposed stiffness model and estimation method were validated through experiments using a planar robotic interface. To assess its performance in practical pHRI tasks, the implementation of human arm stiffness and intention estimation combining with VIC was extended to teleoperation peg-in-hole and robot-assisted rehabilitation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively estimate human motion intention and arm stiffness simultaneously. Compared to existing methods, the proposed VIC enhances pHRI in terms of increased flexibility, effective guidance, and reduced human effort. © 2016 IEEE.},

For indirect intent, it draws inspiration from the speed–curvature–torsion pattern reflecting human motion laws in 3-D space. An expected force model is constructed to characterize the long-term motion objectives of indirect intent. Based on a directional admittance guidance mechanism, the estimated indirect intent enables the robot to collaborate with the operator and provide motion guidance.

	abstract = {An impedance force control framework that enables precise contact force tracking for industrial robots subject to unknown environment dynamics is proposed in this paper. First, a position-based impedance controller is formulated and theoretical analysis reveals that perfect force tracking requires exact knowledge of the environment stiffness and contact position—quantities that are rarely available in practice. To compensate for these uncertainties, a Unified Residual Compensation Iterative Learning Control (URC-ILC) scheme is introduced. Instead of estimating each environment parameter separately, URC-ILC aggregates all modeling errors into a single residual term, which is iteratively updated and fed forward to the impedance loop, guaranteeing stable convergence of the contact force. The controller parameters are tuned off-line by Multi-Directional Particle Swarm Optimization (MDPSO) algorithm, which is developed by (i) injecting four performance-oriented velocity components—response speed, steady-state error, oscillation, and overshoot—into the swarm dynamics, (ii) modulating the inertia weight through a sigmoid schedule, and (iii) applying a mutation operator that prevents premature convergence. Simulations show that MDPSO converges faster and attains higher accuracy than the classical PSO. Experiments further demonstrate that the URC-ILC-based impedance controller, with parameters optimized by MDPSO, reduces steady-state force error by 44.38% relative to the conventional impedance strategy. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach for high-precision, compliant robotic machining under uncertain contact conditions. © IMechE 2025},

By balancing exploration and exploitation during sampling, the algorithm dynamically adjusts its behavior according to the current extension state. In cases of extension failure, principal component analysis is employed to reorient the extension direction, thereby improving pathfinding performance in constrained environments.

	abstract = {With the rapid acceleration of population aging in China, the demand for feeding assistance among individuals with disabilities is becoming increasingly urgent. However, current feeding robots face several limitations such as poor adaptability to complex environments and safety concerns due to rigid structures. In this paper, a new six-degree-of-freedom feeding robot was developed that integrates obstacle avoidance path planning and compliance control. The robotic arm was designed employing a Bi-directional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (Bi-RRT) algorithm to generate collision-avoidance trajectories, while inverse kinematics was solved using the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameter. At the control level, an impedance model-based compliance control strategy was introduced, and its compliant behavior under sudden external forces was verified through dynamic simulations. Prototype experiments demonstrated that the robot could effectively avoid obstacles and respond compliantly to external interference. While the robot achieved a 100% feeding success rate with solid and semi-liquid foods, it occasionally experienced spillage when feeding liquids due to structural limitations of the end-effector. This paper provides both a theoretical framework and practical guidance for enhancing the safety and environmental adaptability of feeding robots. Future work will focus on optimizing the end-effector design to further improve performance with liquid foods. © 2025, Editorial Office of Chinese Quarterly of Mechanic. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this letter, we introduce a Directionally-aware Dynamic Energy Constraint (DSEC-Aware) framework to enhance energy-based safety control in post-collision human-robot collaboration (HRC). The method employs a selective energy dissipation mechanism, applying variable damping only along critical collision directions to effectively reduce impact forces while preserving user motion intentions in non-critical directions. It further adjusts energy boundaries dynamically according to human-robot proximity and introduces a multidimensional Danger Index (DI) model that incorporates physical parameters such as effective mass, contact stiffness, and human tolerance limits for accurate risk evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with state-ofthe-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed strategy reduces collision forces by approximately 58.04% and consistently maintains a low and stable collision risk, thereby significantly improving both the safety and practicality of HRC. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to introduce a coordinated motion planning method for the mobile base and manipulator of a mobile manipulator for the door opening task. This method ensures the end effector dexterity during the operation and enables successful door opening. Design/methodology/approach – Under the task constraint of the door opening operation, velocity directional manipulability is introduced to dynamically evaluate and optimize the pose of the mobile manipulator. Meanwhile, considering that the manipulator’s operational accuracy is significantly higher than the mobile base, the critical motion phases of each component are determined. Furthermore, the passive compliance provided by the end effector’s flexible state gripper provides redundancy to compensate for motion errors, ensuring operational safety during coordinated motion. Findings – Simulation and experimental results show that this method is feasible for the door opening task of the mobile manipulator, and that coordinated motion between the mobile base and manipulator can be achieved. Originality/value – This paper proposes a coordinated motion planning method for mobile manipulators to achieve safe door opening operations. By integrating velocity directional manipulability and leveraging the operational precision differences between components, the method constrains the robot’s motion. Additionally, a flexible state gripper is employed to provide redundancy for motion errors. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Sensing the deformation of soft robots is vital for effective control and interaction with the environment. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables such sensing by monitoring changes in conductivity, but its sensitivity is often highest near the electrodes, limiting performance for distant deformations. Existing strategies to address this limitation typically rely on introducing conductive material heterogeneities, such as anisotropic or patterned conductors, to redirect current flow. In this work, a fundamentally different approach is presented: utilizing a dielectric guide to manipulate the electric field within the conductive body. This method leverages widely used soft robotic materials, such as silicone, in a new role as a passive electric field guide, allowing reconfiguration of sensitivity distributions without embedding conductive components. Physical experiments with a conductive hydrogel cylinder show that the dielectric guide increases deformation sensing accuracy by 21%, reduces sensitivity to noise, and enables a reduction in the number of required EIT channels.

	abstract = {Active woven structures are extensively utilized in wearable and soft robotics due to their exceptional body compliance, lightweight nature, long-term stability, and programmable architectures. Although existing active woven structures have been successfully applied to actuators and sensors, the fabrication of intricate variable stiffness soft robots directly through weaving methods has consistently posed challenges. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the Chinese knot technique and employ thin McKibben muscles to weave a variety of variable stiffness textiles, including a flexible spine, flexible skin, and a bistable structure, as well as innovative soft robots such as a soft crawling robot, a soft enclosed gripper, and a continuum module. Experimental results demonstrate that the variable stiffness range of the developed variable stiffness textiles exceeds 5.4 times that of the initial stiffness. Furthermore, we also experimentally demonstrate that the woven soft crawling robot (weighing 171 g) can achieve omnidirectional movement on an ferromagnetic surface at a maximum speed of 666.7 mm/min; the woven continuum module (weighing 49 g) can reduce the impact of external forces on the motion angle by over 65% by activating the high stiffness mode; the soft enclosed gripper (weighing 175 g) can lift objects weighing up to 14.7 kg, and the variable stiffness function can enhance its multi-directional bearing capacity by ∼3.3 times. This study offers various new configurations and ideas for the advancement of complex variable stiffness soft robots based on weaving technology. © 2025 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers},

	abstract = {In physical human-robot interaction, force feedback has been the most common sensing modality to convey the human intention to the robot. It is widely used in admittance control to allow the human to direct the robot. However, it cannot be used in scenarios where direct force feedback is not available since manipulated objects are not always equipped with a force sensor. In this work, we study one such scenario: the collaborative pushing and pulling of heavy objects on frictional surfaces, a prevalent task in industrial settings. When humans do it, they communicate through verbal and non-verbal cues, where body poses, and movements often convey more than words. We propose a novel context-aware approach using Directed Graph Neural Networks to analyze spatiotemporal human posture data to predict human motion intention for non-verbal collaborative physical manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that robot assistance significantly reduces human effort and improves task efficiency. The results indicate that incorporating posture-based context recognition, either together with or as an alternative to force sensing, enhances robot decision-making and control efficiency. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sustaining the gait locomotion in an adversarial environment requires the robot to react to novel experiences adaptively. In Free Energy Principle (FEP), the behavioral reaction is driven by the discrepancy between observation and prediction. Although, for legged robot gait locomotion, the prediction of gait dynamics is challenging as the consequences non-linearly depend on the activity history, the animal gait is robust, adapting to severe motion disruptions seemingly instantly. In biomimetic robotics, the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) relaxes the general dynamics of body-environment interaction to the stable and repetitive dynamics of gait. Based on these observations, we propose self-learning of the gait dynamics model and FEP framework that infers state estimation and gait control. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on a real hexapod walking robot with 18 controllable degrees of freedom. The robot learns the gait dynamics model indoors and then deploys it in outdoor navigation under various adversarial scenarios.

Motivated by the concept of mechanical intelligence [1], where controls for obstacle navigation can be offloaded to passive body mechanics in terrestrial limbless locomotion, we hypothesize that principles of mechanical intelligence can be extended to cluttered hydrodynamic regimes. To test this, we developed an untethered limbless robot capable of undulatory swimming on water surfaces, utilizing a bilateral cable-driven mechanism inspired by organismal muscle actuation morphology to achieve programmable anisotropic body compliance. We demonstrated through robophysical experiments that, similar to terrestrial locomotion, an appropriate level of body compliance can facilitate emergent swim through complex hydrodynamic environments under pure open-loop control. Moreover, we found that swimming performance depends on undulation frequency, with effective locomotion achieved only within a specific frequency range. This contrasts with highly damped terrestrial regimes, where inertial effects can often be neglected. Further, to enhance performance and address the challenges posed by nondeterministic obstacle distributions, we incorporated computational intelligence by developing a real-time body compliance tuning controller based on cable tension feedback. This controller improves the robot's robustness and overall speed in heterogeneous hydrodynamic environments. © 2025 IEEE.},

Our proposed multimodal association mechanism enhances the fusion process, establishing a robust computational methodology. We train the model using a newly collected dataset that captures the grasping dynamics of a soft gripper equipped with multimodal perception capabilities. By incorporating the current state and image differences, the forward model can predict the soft gripper’s physical interaction and movement in the image flow, which amounts to imagining future motion events. Moreover, we showcase effective predictions across modalities as well as for grasping outcomes.

In order for robots to be introduced into more situations, such as caregiving, it is also necessary for people to feel that they can rely on robots. The key to making people feel that they can rely on robots is to improve their perception of agency toward the robot. Humans are generally considered to have agency, and they behave actively based on their motivation to achieve certain goals. If a robot behaves actively based on the equivalent of a human's motivation, then the people's perception of agency toward the robot would be improved.

When using robot to dock and capture the tumbling target, a huge drag force from the target would seriously threaten the structure of the robot. To minimize the momentum transport during capturing process, a multi-arm robot with omni-directional wheel end-effectors is put forward to safely damp the tumbling motion. Based on whole-body impedance control, the force planning strategy of multiple contact points for the multi-arm robot is designed, which can prevent the target from escaping and detumble its motion continuously and stably. Concerning the closed loop formed while the robot arms is in multi-point compliant contact with the target, the normal and tangential forces of every contact point are evaluated in this method. The normal force, derived from the compliant control of arm configuration, is used to achieve nutation angle damping. And the tangential force, which is the friction from the omni-directional spherical wheel, can damp the spinning velocity smoothly. The simulation results show the efficiency of the tumbling motion damping process. © 2025 IEEE.},

In this article, an adaptive variable impedance control method based on real-time human stiffness estimation is proposed to significantly extend the applicability of traditional impedance control. First, a stiffness estimation model based on surface electromyography (sEMG) is developed to infer human intention by designing a visual feedback perturbation method for data acquisition and parameter identification. Then, a constraint based on a velocity mapping band is implemented to enhance compliance during interaction, while an adaptive variable stiffness constant force tracking algorithm is introduced to meet the force control requirements of specific task scenarios. Furthermore, two variable impedance control strategies incorporating human intention are proposed for different collaborative interaction scenarios. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through two human–robot collaborative tasks: sawing and wiping. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sustaining the robot's longevity becomes challenging in dynamic deployments characterized by new unknown environments and embodiments outside of the prior knowledge. Hence, the knowledge of robot-environment interactions needs to be continually updated for system adaptation. It can be implemented through self-verification as a continual comparison of predictions with observations using the predictive coding (PC) principle. The principle has been further extended into the active inference control (AIC) in biomimetic robotics to drive the control, state estimation, and model update. However, continually updating one model leads to catastrophic forgetting in the long term. Therefore, we propose an autonomously expanding self-verifying world model (WM) of sensorimotor dynamics utilized in model-based gait control. The model combines PC with the incremental knowledge representation based on the internal model (IM) principle. The proposed method is experimentally validated in virtual and real scenarios, where the hexapod walking robot has to recognize and adapt to leg paralysis and then recognize the recovery. The method generates novel behaviors in real time, improving the performance and outperforming the examined state-of-the-art methods.

	abstract = {Physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) is important for seamless collaboration, improved efficiency, and flexibility whilst robots perform their tasks. Unlike many studies that have focused primarily on single-arm manipulator pHRI, this study specifically addressed the pHRI challenges associated with dual-arm manipulator systems, which can be more difficult problems to solve owing to the inclusion of force couplings, kinematic constraints, uncalibrated trajectory deviations, and uncertainties related to the controlled object. Specifically, this study proposed a human-intention estimation and two-level admittance adaptation control scheme for dual-arm manipulators pHRI, to estimate unknown human motion intent, reduce human effort, and implement effective force control under conditions of uncertainty. An adaptive neural network was employed to estimate the unknown human motion intent, enabling two manipulators to actively follow human movements. An object-level force feedback variable damping admittance controller (FFVDAC) was proposed to enhance pHRI compliance and minimize human effort by adjusting the damping parameters. In addition, a novel manipulator-level neural-network-based variable stiffness admittance controller (NNVSAC) was proposed to effectively control the internal forces under conditions of uncertainty. The stability of the object-level FFVDAC and manipulator level NNVSAC were demonstrated through the Routh criterion and Lyapunov stability analysis, respectively. To confirm the feasibility and superiority of the proposed pHRI control scheme, a series of pHRI and dual-arm manipulators cooperation experiments were conducted using two redundant manipulators. The results clearly demonstrated that the proposed control scheme can successfully reduce human effort and internal force oscillations. Moreover, comparative analysis revealed the proposed algorithm's superior performance. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

The robot adopts an inchworm-like peristaltic motion for its bellow-structured body, and it utilizes a self-locking mechanism, realized by exploiting the anisotropic interaction of its reconfigurable fins with the pipe ridges, to achieve the desired locomotion. A feature of the design is that the robot robustly moves by an integral multiple of the ridge-to-ridge distance per actuation cycle, allowing the robot to self-localize within the pipe. Experiments are conducted to characterize the stress-strain relationship of the 3D-printed compliant material (thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)). The results are used in finite element analysis (FEA)-based design of the bellows structure and the fins for achieving the desired compliance and stiffness anisotropy, respectively. Experiments on a robot prototype inside a four-inch drainage pipe have confirmed the utility of the FEA-based design in achieving sound anisotropic fin stiffness, and the robot's capability to travel a fixed number of ridge-to-ridge distances per actuation cycle, determined by the contraction/expansion stroke. The robot also demonstrates robust locomotion in curved or vertical pipes. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this article, we address the development of a robotic rehabilitation system for the upper limbs based on collaborative end-effector solutions. The use of commercial collaborative robots offers significant advantages for this task, as they are optimized from an engineering perspective and ensure safe physical interaction with humans. However, they also come with noticeable drawbacks, such as the limited range of sizes available on the market and the standard control modes, which are primarily oriented toward industrial or service applications. To address these limitations, we propose an optimization-based design method to fully exploit the capability of the cobot in performing rehabilitation tasks. In addition, we introduce a novel control architecture based on an admittance-type virtual fixture method, which constrains the motion of the robot along a prescribed path. This approach allows for an intuitive definition of the task to be performed via programming by demonstration and enables the system to operate both passively and actively. In passive mode, the system supports the patient during task execution with additional force, while in active mode, it opposes the motion with a braking force. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

Then, a dual-layer fuzzy adaptive constraint strategy is developed to dynamically adjust the constraint scope, ensuring precision, flexibility, and safety within the 3D task space. Experimental results indicated that, in comparison to conventional adaptive admittance control, the proposed method can increase operational compliance by 27.56% and 12.84% during translation and rotation, and reduce interaction forces by 31.88% and 23.76% during translation and rotation, respectively.

	abstract = {A fundamental challenge of shared autonomy is to use high-DoF robots to assist, rather than hinder, humans by first inferring user intent and then empowering the user to achieve their intent. Although successful, prior methods either rely heavily on a priori knowledge of all possible human intents or require many demonstrations and interactions with the human to learn these intents before being able to assist the user. We propose and study a zero-shot, vision-only shared autonomy (VOSA) frame-work designed to allow robots to use end-effector vision to estimate zero-shot human intents in conjunction with blended control to help humans accomplish manipulation tasks with unknown and dynamically changing object locations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our VOSA framework, we instantiate a simple version of VOSA on a Kinova Gen3 manipulator and evaluate our system by conducting a user study on three tabletop manipulation tasks. The performance of VOSA matches that of an oracle baseline model that receives privileged knowledge of possible human intents while also requiring significantly less effort than unassisted teleoperation. In more realistic settings, where the set of possible human intents is fully or partially unknown, we demonstrate that VOSA requires less human effort and time than baseline approaches while being preferred by a majority of the participants. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of using off-the-shelf vision algorithms to enable flexible and beneficial shared control of a robot manipulator.

	abstract = {With the rapid progress of the computer, communication, and consumer (3C) industry, robotic assembly tasks have become more important and challenging, such as the assembly of flexible printed circuits (FPCs) in mobile phones. Due to the interference fit and the low stiffness of the connection, the assembly of FPC faces two primary challenges: precise positioning as well as compliance and safety of contact. Vision-based methods cannot sense contact forces, which may result in damage, while six-dimensional force methods fail to adequately capture the contact state between connectors. In contrast, tactile feedback can resolve these challenges. Current tactile-based FPC assembly strategies only detect the FPC’s position, overlooking the mobile phone’s position error and the error introduced by the transfer after identification. This article proposes a novel FPC assembly strategy that fuses tactile feedback and six-dimensional force to address existing challenges. First, a tactile skewness analysis model is proposed to correct the end-effector’s orientation error. Next, a contact state recognition model is developed by combining the tactile data from the contact surface and the six-dimensional force from the robot arm when the male and female connectors are in contact, which enables the classification of position error directions. The position error is then corrected through the proposed directional searching and snap-fitting strategy. Finally, experiments validate the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing both orientation and position errors. Compared to traditional methods, it improves assembly efficiency and prevents snap-fitting failure caused by male and female connectors losing contact. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

However, traditional virtual fixtures with constant stiffness are inadequate for scenarios where robots need to leave the constraints to perform tasks. To address this, we propose an adaptive virtual fixture based on the motion refinement tube, which dynamically adjusts the guiding force according to the distribution of trajectories. To prevent tube deformation in the Cartesian space due to the neglect of off-diagonal elements of covariance matrices, the refinement tube radii and nonlinear stiffness terms are computed in local coordinate systems based on the decomposed covariance matrix. An energy-tank-based passivity controller is designed to ensure system stability when employing the virtual fixture with state-dependent stiffness terms. In the validation tests with 18 participants, the proposed method showed improvements in task efficiency (18.69% increase) and collision avoidance (97.87% reduction) for a typical pick-and-place task with scattered materials. It also provided better subjective experiences of the users than traditional virtual fixtures. Meanwhile, compared with the method that neglects off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, the proposed method exhibited a 4.28% efficiency improvement and a 40.42% decrease in collision occurrences. © 2013 IEEE.},

Despite their potential, robotic technologies remain limited to selected spine procedures. Meanwhile, complex and time-consuming procedures, such as osteotomy, are still performed manually, impacting surgeon workload and stress. This paper introduces a robotic system to assist surgeons during the drilling of the vertebral body, enhancing precision and improving patient outcomes. The system integrates a pre-planning tool for establishing the desired correction angle, a virtual fixture-based impedance control algorithm to assist the user in following cutting trajectories while safeguarding surrounding structures, and a navigation tool for enhanced procedural guidance. The system consists of a 7 Degree-of-Freedom robotic manipulator equipped with a drilling system attached to its end-effector. System accuracy was validated on 5 vertebral phantoms, achieving tracking errors of 0.39 ± 0.033 mm and 0.74 ± 0.07 mm, margin errors of 0.84 ± 0.17 mm and 0.19 ± 0.5 mm, and angular alignment errors of 0.34 ± 0.16 and 0.13 ± 0.27° for the sagittal and coronal planes, respectively. Additionally, the system's performance was evaluated with real porcine bone, with results demonstrating similar precision and robustness under realistic mechanical properties. A user Study was conducted to evaluate whether the proposed system effectively enhanced user performance compared to a manual control strategy. The results demonstrated reduced deviation from the desired path and fewer instances of the system exceeding predetermined restricted areas when using the proposed system. Additionally, participants rated the proposed system as less mentally and physically demanding in comparison to the traditional control strategy. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Wearable robots, especially those composed of soft materials, are increasingly attracting interest due to their comfort, ease of donning and doffing, and their ability to provide assistance across various applications. In wearable robotics, striking a balance between ensuring low impedance for wearer comfort and providing sufficient assistive force is a notable design challenge. In this study, we propose exploiting impedance variation in accordance with the types of muscle contraction in the human body. Particularly in eccentric muscle contraction, the impedance can help reduce the muscular load, since it exerts force in the same direction as the muscles. To utilize the relation, we proposed a linked-layer jamming mechanism, which adjusts its impedance largely in various directions. This mechanism allows not only a broad variable range of impedance in multiple rotation directions but also directional torque design, even when equipped in human multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joints. By constructing a wearable robot prototype equipped with the proposed linked-layer jamming mechanisms, the effectiveness of this impedance-based assistance approach was confirmed through experiments. The findings from this study present new possibilities in wearable robot design, showing that suitably amplified impedance can assist human motion, potentially enhancing task efficiency and lowering injury risk. This work thus offers a new perspective for researchers in the field of wearable robots, demonstrating that impedance, often minimized in existing designs, can be utilized beneficially when properly amplified. © The Author(s) 2024.

	abstract = {Aiming at the problem of defining the shortest distance between poses in traditional virtual fixtures, this paper proposes a proxy-based guidance virtual fixtures with orientation constraints, which can assist operators in the path following task. By designing the dynamics of the proxy and then connecting it to the robot using a spring-damping model, the end-effector position can be constrained within the pipeline and cone, and the stiffness coefficients of the virtual forces can be adjusted linearly or nonlinearly. To overcome the cumulative errors, we then propose a discretized improved algorithm, which applies the virtual fixtures on a discretized reference curve. Furthermore, the orientation constraints are defined, and hence the end-effector orientation can also be constrained within a specific range to comply with ergonomics. An experiment was conducted using a Franka Emika Panda robot and involving 9 subjects. The results show that compared to the gravity compensation mode, the pipeline virtual fixtures and the virtual fixtures with the pipeline and cone, as proposed in this paper, reduced task completion time by 38% and 44.7%, respectively.

	abstract = {Robot-assisted arthroscopic surgery has been receiving growing attention in the field of orthopedic surgery. Most of the existing robot-assisted surgical systems in orthopedics place more focus on open surgery than minimally invasive surgery (MIS). In traditional arthroscopic surgery, the surgeon needs to hold an arthroscope with one hand while performing the surgical operations with the other hand, which can restrict the dexterity of the surgical performance and increase the cognitive load. On the other hand, the surgeon heavily relies on the arthroscope view when conducting the surgery, whereas the arthroscope view is a largely localized view and lacks depth information. To assist the surgeon in both scenarios, in this work, we develop a two-arm robotic system. The left-arm robot is used as a robot-assisted arthroscope holder, and it can hold the arthroscope still at a designated pose and reject all other potential disturbances, while also allowing the operator to move it via a pedal switch whenever needed. The left-arm robot is implemented with an impedance controller and a gravity iterative learning (Git) scheme, where the former can provide compliant robot behavior, thus ensuring a safe human-robot interaction, while the latter can accurately learn for gravity compensation. The right-arm robot is used as a robot-assisted surgical tool, providing virtual fixture (VF) assistance and haptic feedback during the surgery. The right-arm robot is implemented with a point-based VF algorithm, which can generate VF directly from point clouds in any shape, render force feedback, and deliver it to the operator. Furthermore, the VF, the bone, and the surgical tool position are visualized in a 3D digital environment as additional visual feedback for the operator. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype. The results demonstrate that both arms can provide satisfactory assistance as designed. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

The high compliance and low stiffness, however, causes low rigidity and ambiguity in control when it is applied to grasping and manipulating an object. In this study, we develop a ball-jointed tendon-driven continuum robot that can bend to arbitrary directions for manipulating and grasping an object. Discs are connected by ball joints, together with coil springs coupled with tendon threads, and form a backbone of the robotic body. The continuum robot is operated to bend to an arbitrary direction by pulling the tendons using three servomotors, and returns to the original straight shape by releasing the pulling force of the contracted coil springs. The robot is constructed by using 3D-printed parts. In the experiment, the ability of the multi-directional operation was tested by bending the continuum body to specific directions, and then performing arc-following motion. Furthermore, the manipulator's grasping performance was demonstrated by preparing five objects that have various shapes, sizes, and softness. The robot successfully grasped all the objects by wrapping around them and adapting its shape to the object's shapes. The experiments verified the satisfactory operability of the continuum robot. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Object handover is a fundamental task for collaborative robots, particularly service robots. In in-home assistance scenarios, individuals often face constraints due to their posture and declining physical functions, necessitating high demands on robots for flexible real-time control and intuitive interactions. During robot-to-human handovers, individuals are limited to making perceptual judgements based on the appearance of the object and the consistent behaviour of the robot. This hinders their comprehensive perception and may lead to unexpected dangerous behaviour. Various handover trajectories pose challenges to predictive robot control and motion coordination. Many studies have shown that force guidance can provide adequate information to the receivers. However, force modulation with intention judgements based on velocity, acceleration, or jerk may impede the intended motion and require additional effort. In this paper, starting from a human-to-human handover study, an anisotropic variable force-guided robot-to-human handover control method is proposed to overcome the cognition-reality gap. The retraction motion was decoupled based on a fitted motion plane and a task-related linear trajectory, which served as a reference for overshoot suppression and impedance force modulation. The experimental results and user surveys show that the anisotropic variable impedance force suppresses overshooting without impeding the intended motions, giving the receiver sufficient time for behavioural adjustments and assisting them in completing a safe and efficient handover in a preferred manner. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper presents a mobile supernumerary robotic approach to physical assistance in human–robot conjoined actions. The study starts with the description of the SUPER-MAN concept. The idea is to develop and utilize mobile collaborative systems that can follow human loco-manipulation commands to perform industrial tasks through three main components: (i) an admittance-type interface, (ii) a human–robot interaction controller and (iii) a supernumerary robotic body. Next, we present two possible implementations within the framework — from theoretical and hardware perspectives. The first system is called MOCA-MAN, and is composed of a redundant torque-controlled robotic arm and an omni-directional mobile platform. The second one is called Kairos-MAN, formed by a high-payload 6-DoF velocity-controlled robotic arm and an omni-directional mobile platform. The systems share the same admittance interface, through which user wrenches are translated to loco-manipulation commands, generated by whole-body controllers of each system. Besides, a thorough user-study with multiple and cross-gender subjects is presented to reveal the quantitative performance of the two systems in effort demanding and dexterous tasks. Moreover, we provide qualitative results from the NASA-TLX questionnaire to demonstrate the SUPER-MAN approach's potential and its acceptability from the users’ viewpoint. © 2024},

In this study, we proposed a novel variable admittance model designed for robotic mobile platforms. The proposed admittance model achieves the decoupling of the desired dynamics related to the intended motion direction from that of the unintentional motion, ensuring that changes in one space do not affect the other. In the unintentional space, the admittance parameters remain constant, while the inertia and damping gains along the intended motion direction are adjusted to provide compliance to the human user. The design of these variable terms was performed to ensure a consistent response, aiming to offer a perceived consistent behavior to the human user and to guarantee strict passivity under human force input, ensuring manipulation stability. In addition to theoretical proof of passivity, we validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed control scheme through experimental results using an omni-directional robotic mobile platform. © 2016 IEEE.},

The human actions are often encoded by the internal states that are attributed to human characteristics and rationality. First, by leveraging a continuous level of rationality, we compute the belief on human rationality along with his/her characteristic. This systematically reasons out the uncertainty in the observed human action, thereby better assessing the potential safety risks during the interaction. Second, based on the computed belief over the human internal states, we formulate a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) problem to plan the robot's actions such that it safely achieves its goal while also actively inferring on the human internal state. To cope with the expensive computation of the SMPC, we develop a sampling-based technique that efficiently evaluates the robot's action conditioned on human uncertainty. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed strategy excels in human action prediction, and significantly improves the safety and efficiency of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Human–robot collaboration (HRC) systems integrate the strengths of humans and robots to improve joint system performance. In particular, human–robot cooperative manipulation (co-manipulation), a prominent area within the field of HRC, in which humans and robots manipulate the same object, has garnered significant attention. Trust in HRC is crucial in determining the level of human acceptance of robots and, hence, robot utilization. This paper develops a probabilistic dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)-based trust model and trust-aware variable impedance control for human–robot co-manipulation. Due to the continuous nature of trust evolution and the limitation of the classic parameter learning approach, a continuous and normalized version of Baum–Welch (BW) algorithm is developed to learn the trust model. Trust is vital in any HRC task, such as human–robot co-manipulation. To achieve successful co-manipulation, it is necessary to take into account human–robot trust and further facilitate seamless HRC. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive framework with trust-aware variable impedance control of robot behavior for human–robot co-manipulation, based on human trust in robot and force-based human intention estimation, with trust-based obstacle avoidance and trust-based robot-level task hierarchy. An extensive case study on human–robot co-transportation is conducted, encompassing five distinct robot behaviors, namely, compliant, autonomous, switching control-based, variable impedance control based only on human applied force, and our proposed trust-based variable impedance control behaviors. A rigorous statistical analysis is performed to test their statistical significance and our trust-aware variable impedance control strategy demonstrated its superiority in terms of efficiency, agreement, safety, pHRI, and sHRI factors compared to other benchmark behaviors. The statistical findings also indicate that our proposed trust model has the ability to reflect human subjective surveyed trust qualitatively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Any such framework should also be systematically customizable for individual users. Our work is motivated by the lack of such control frameworks for upper-limb rehabilitation exoskeletons. To address this shortcoming, we have proposed a method that consists of a two-port admittance controller in the task space which regulates the interaction between the exoskeleton and the user in both wrist and upper arm interaction points. Parameters of the virtual model in the wrist interaction port are dynamically adjusted based on both the performance and the intention of the subject, realizing a minimally intervening controller. The upper arm admittance model on the other hand, modulates how strictly reference shoulder-elbow synergies are enforced, making the proposed approach useful for various stages of rehabilitation. To achieve this, interaction forces measured between the exoskeleton and the upper-arm are used to modify the joint reference trajectories (generated by a model-based redundancy resolution strategy) in the null space of wrist motions. This letter presents a complete formulation of the introduced method, proof of the variable-admittance controller's passivity, and experimental results verifying the feasibility and performance of the proposed controller. © 2016 IEEE.},

From this model, velocity-curvature patterns are derived, enabling an intuitive estimation of indirect intentions indicating long-term objectives like trajectory and turning direction. We propose an innovative guidance method, rooted in the estimation of indirect human intentions, enabling the robot to concurrently follow and guide the operator. To assess the efficacy of this approach, both offline simulations and real-time human experiments are conducted on a six-DOF robot and a force/torque sensor.

	abstract = {Force feedback generally increases the effectiveness of execution and sense of embodiment on telemanipulation systems. However, systems with force feedback are vulnerable to time delays, reducing their transparency and stability. In this letter, we implement a bi-directional impedance reflection controller, a concept that was presented already in 1989 by Blake Hannaford Hannaford et al. 1989 but was never fully implemented. In this method, the simplified impedances of the operator and the environment are reflected back to the remote robot and haptic interface, respectively. A trajectory predictor is added to compensate for the delayed motion. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the system in a user study, comparing it to a system with a classical bilateral impedance controller with passivity layers. Three time delay groups (0, 10, and 20 ms one-way delay) of 10 participants each executed different tasks with both controllers. The results show that the bi-directional impedance reflection controller performs significantly better in the 10 ms and 20 ms time delay groups, in terms of task performance, user experience and sense of embodiment. We conclude that this study is the first to show that bi-directional impedance reflection can be effectively used with time delays of at least 20 ms. © 2016 IEEE.},

Human limb dynamic model is regarded as mechanical impedance model, and human motion intention is estimated online based on Gaussian process. A variable impedance control method is proposed to make the MRM comply with human motion intention in the process of pHRI. A decentralized sliding mode control strategy is designed to achieve high performance position tracking and compensate the uncertainty of the controller. Based on Lyapunov theory, the uniform ultimately bounded of tracking error of each joint is proved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method under pHRI is verified by experiments.

	abstract = {Fine assembly tasks, such as electrical connector insertion have tight tolerances and sensitive components, requiring compensation of alignment errors while applying sufficient force in the insertion direction, ideally at high speeds and while grasping a range of components. Vision, tactile, or force sensors can compensate alignment errors, but have limited bandwidth, limiting the safe assembly speed. Passive compliance, such as silicone-based fingers can reduce collision forces and grasp a range of components, but often cannot provide the accuracy or assembly forces required. To support high-speed mechanical search and self-aligning insertion, this article proposes monolithic additively manufactured fingers which realize a moderate, structured compliance directly proximal to the gripped object. The geometry of finray-effect fingers are adapted to add form-closure features and realize a directionally dependent stiffness at the fingertip, with a high stiffness to apply insertion forces and lower transverse stiffness to support alignment. Design parameters and mechanical properties of the fingers are investigated with finite element method (FEM) and empirical studies, analyzing the stiffness, maximum load, and viscoelastic effects. The fingers realize a remote center of compliance, which is shown to depend on the rib angle, and a directional stiffness ratio of 14-36. The fingers are applied to a plug insertion task, realizing a tolerance window of 7.5 mm and approach speeds of 1.3 m/s. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this study, an adaptive object deformability-agnostic human-robot collaborative transportation framework is presented. The proposed framework enables to combine the haptic information transferred through the object with the human kinematic information obtained from a motion capture system to generate reactive whole-body motions on a mobile collaborative robot. Furthermore, it allows rotating the objects in an intuitive and accurate way during co-transportation based on an algorithm that detects the human rotation intention using the torso and hand movements. First, we validate the framework with the two extremities of the object deformability range (i.e., purely rigid aluminum rod and highly deformable rope) by utilizing a mobile manipulator which consists of an Omni-directional mobile base and a collaborative robotic arm. Next, its performance is compared with an admittance controller during a co-carry task of a partially deformable object in a 12-subjects user study. Quantitative and qualitative results of this experiment show that the proposed framework can effectively handle the transportation of objects regardless of their deformability and provides intuitive assistance to human partners. Finally, we have demonstrated the potential of our framework in a different scenario, where the human and the robot co-transport a manikin using a deformable sheet. Note to Practitioners - Transportation of objects which requires the cooperation of multiple partners, is a common task in industrial settings such as factories and warehouses. The existing human-robot collaboration solutions for this task have focused only on purely rigid objects, although deformable objects need to be carried frequently in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a human-robot collaborative transportation framework that can handle objects with different deformability ranging from purely rigid to highly deformable. In particular, the proposed framework generates whole-body movements on a mobile collaborative robot by combining of the haptic information transmitted through the object and the human motion information obtained from a motion capture system. Moreover, the framework includes an intuitive way to rotate the object during the execution based on human hand and torso motion. The results of the experiments where objects with various deformability characteristics were transported in collaboration with a mobile manipulator demonstrated the high potential of the proposed approach in a laboratory setting. In the future, we plan to employ a less expensive vision-based human motion tracking system instead of the IMU-based system used in this study. With this change, we will be able to eliminate the need for wearable sensors from the framework presented, which would enhance its usability in real-world scenarios. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {At present, the serious challenge of human-robot collaboration is how to establish an interaction interface with multi-directional interactivity and robustness. This paper applies surface electromyography (sEMG) signals as the interface medium, and proposes a robust 3D arm strength estimation model based on hybrid deep learning networks (R3DNet) to build a stable interaction interface and achieve reliable human-robot collaboration performance in 3D operation scenarios. R3DNet adopts the modular design idea and includes a feature extraction module, a regression estimation module, and a robust enhancement module. In the feature extraction module, an autoencoder structure-based network and a new loss function are proposed to extract the fusion features of multi-channel sEMG signals. In the regression estimation module, an arm strength model based on transfer learning algorithms is proposed. This model considers the similarity of arm strength estimation in each direction and realizes the arm strength estimation from one to three dimensions through the fine-tune strategy. The robust enhancement module adopts a residual structure and aims to address the problem of poor model robustness due to non-ideal conditions such as electrode displacement, muscle fatigue, muscle time-varying characteristics and differences in muscle characteristics among subjects. Further, an improved adaptive admittance control method is proposed to help the robot to adjust collaborative behavior according to the changing arm strength of the human tutor. The results of comparison experiments and multi-point flexible assembly experiments verify the validity and engineering realizability of R3DNet for human-robot collaboration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The trajectory planning of the arm is greatly facilitated by the physical direct teaching technology. Variable admittance control is a promising technology when a robot is interacting with a variable environment, such as a human whose stiffness might change during the interaction. Nevertheless, a canonical admittance controller with imperfect parameters may lead to robot oscillation, which brings more challenges to a variable admittance controller. In this paper, we propose an energy-based variable admittance controller with intrinsic oscillation suppression property. During the physical human–robot interaction (pHRI), the human intention is predicted based on the robot's state and interaction force. The admittance parameters are tuned automatically to conform the robot's motion to human intention. When the oscillation is detected online by the proposed wavelet module, our variable admittance model reveals oscillation suppression ability because of dissipating the energy generated by high-frequency oscillation. We compared the proposed variable admittance controller with other admittance controller approaches in both simulation and actual robot experiments. The proposed method shows significant improvement in oscillation suppression and human energy conservation in the human–robot interaction application. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The end dynamic characteristics dominated by the milling robot's body structure play a crucial role in vibration control and chatter avoidance in robotic milling. As the excitation source, the milling force may exist in any direction under different process parameters. Consequently, investigating the directional distribution of the end dynamic characteristics becomes essential for studying the direction-dependent dynamic response of a milling robot. In this paper, firstly, the directionality of the end modal vibration is proved based on the body structure mode shape of the milling robot. Subsequently, combined with the multi-body dynamics model of milling robots, the distribution of the end dynamic compliance with the excitation direction in the robot mode is modeled and found to be double-sphere, which is verified experimentally. A convenient method for acquiring the double-sphere dynamic compliance (DSDC) is given and its portability is shown. Then, two application cases of the DSDC in milling vibration suppression are given. In Case 1, based on the DSDC, the milling vibration amplitude is found to be distributed as an eccentric ellipse with a non-orthogonal basis with the feed angle in a robot mode, wherein a feed direction selection method for reducing milling vibration without traversal calculation is given with experimental validation. Case 2 shows that according to the guidance of the DSDC, the tuned mass damper can significantly suppress the milling vibration. It is worth noting that the directionality of the end modal vibration and DSDC constitute fundamental dynamic properties of milling robots, which may provide a new theoretical basis for the research related to the robotic end dynamic characteristics (such as frequency response function identification, mode coupling chatter mechanism and its suppression, etc.), which are well worth exploring. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Robotic manipulation holds the potential to replace humans in the execution of tedious or dangerous tasks. However, control-based approaches are not suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Therefore, applying manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a novel framework for skill learning in robotic manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (TactileAIRL), aimed at achieving efficient learning. To enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference, which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we have designed universal tactile static and dynamic features based on vision-based tactile sensors, making our framework scalable to many manipulation tasks learning involving tactile feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly high training efficiency in objects pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks with just few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline. Furthermore, we conduct physical experiments on a gripper screwing task using our method, which showcases the algorithm's rapid learning capability and its potential for practical applications. © 2024 IEEE.},

To this end, a two-layered learning-based human intention recognition mechanism is proposed, utilizing only the kinematic and kinetic data from the robot and two force sensors. A "subtask detector"recognizes the human intent by estimating which phase of the task is being performed, e.g., Idle, Tool-Attachment, Driving, and Contact. Simultaneously, a "motion estimator"continuously quantifies intent more precisely during the Driving to predict when Contact will begin. The controller is adapted online according to the subtask while allowing early adaptation before the Contact to maximize precision and safety and prevent potential instabilities. Three sets of pHRI experiments were performed with multiple subjects under various conditions. Spring compression experiments were performed in virtual environments to train the data-driven models and validate the proposed adaptive system, and drilling experiments were performed in the physical world to test the proposed methods' efficacy in real-life scenarios. Experimental results show subtask classification accuracy of 84% and motion estimation R<sup>2</sup> score of 0.96. Furthermore, 57% lower human effort was achieved during Driving as well as 53% lower oscillation amplitude at Contact as a result of the proposed system. © 2024 IEEE.},

Here we propose an experimental setup and a methodology for estimating the passive stiffness of the human wrist across two coupled Degrees of Freedom (DoFs): Flexo-Extension (FE) and Radio-Ulnar Deviation (RUD). A robotic arm passively moved the participant's wrist, whose movements and interaction forces/torques were recorded through infrared cameras and a 6-axis load cell, respectively. Conversely to most previous studies, that approximated wrist angular displacements and torques with the robot joint angles and torques, we considered a wrist kinematic model with two orthogonal axes (FE and RUD) intersecting at the wrist center of rotation. We tested our method on four healthy volunteers and employed multiple linear regression to estimate 2-by-2 stiffness matrix and represent its symmetric component in the form of a stiffness ellipse. The results were comparable with the prior literature. Specifically, the joint stiffness in the FE-RUD space was confirmed to be anisotropic, with the stiffness along RUD higher than along FE, and with the axis of maximum stiffness tilted counterclockwise of a few degrees with respect to the pure RUD axis. © 2024 IEEE.},

In this paper, human teleoperated demonstrations are combined with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to decrease the convergence time of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that automatically estimates the parameters of a VF for a Pegin-Hole insertion task. The acceleration of the convergence allows us to also estimate parameters of more intricate VFs, where the RL algorithm did not converge otherwise. The experiments show that this technique can successfully infer the expected parameters of predefined VFs in a third of the time compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Additionally, the learned behaviour of the robot manipulator in simulation is executed on a robot arm using an impedance controller to demonstrate that the virtual system closely replicates its real counterpart, and that the learned VFs have higher chances of being useful to a user controlling the real system. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Rigid robots excel in structured conditions but struggle in more unpredictable or populated environments. Soft robots address these difficulties, but the compliance which gives them their inherent safety also limits their ability to apply desired forces. Jamming/locking reduces this back-drivability but does not allow for directional application of force. We present a hybrid system including pneumatic and tendon actuation as well as a system of cable-driven locking modules, able lock individual joints. Combining these mechanisms yields a device, which can behave as: a soft finger, a fully-rigid finger, and a locally-locking finger which mimics a traditional rigid-link robot. This finger is able to switch between these behaviors on-the-fly, allowing it to adapt to unexpected scenarios, critical for social robots. Using these modes and the ability to adapt real-time, our finger is able to complete common household tasks, difficult for current robots. We characterize the finger's ability to resist force in three actuation modes (Pneumatic, Cable, and Locked), its ability to apply force, and its ability to actuate in 31 different configurations (plus a static all-locked configuration). We also present a demonstration in which the finger conforms to the shape of a computer mouse then clicks a mouse button, and of the finger conforms to the shape of a heavy door handle, then pulling it open.

Nevertheless, the future industry demands innovative solutions to streamline the interaction process between humans and drones to enable seamless collaboration and efficient coworking. In this paper, we present a novel tele-immersive framework that promotes cognitive and physical collaboration between humans and robots through Mixed Reality (MR). This framework incorporates a novel bi-directional spatial awareness and a multi-modal virtual-physical interaction approaches. The former seamlessly integrates the physical and virtual worlds, offering bidirectional egocentric and exocentric environmental representations. The latter, leveraging the proposed spatial representation, further enhances the collaboration combining a robot planning algorithm for obstacle avoidance with a variable admittance control. This allows users to issue commands based on virtual forces while maintaining compatibility with the environment map. We validate the proposed approach by performing several collaborative planning and exploration tasks involving a drone and an user equipped with a MR headset. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Preserving and encouraging mobility in the elderly and adults with chronic conditions is of paramount importance. However, existing walking aids are either inadequate to provide sufficient support to users' stability or too bulky and poorly maneuverable to be used outside hospital environments. In addition, they all lack adaptability to individual requirements. To address these challenges, this paper introduces WANDER, a novel Walking Assistive omNi-Directional Exo-Robot. It consists of an omnidirectional platform and a robust aluminum structure mounted on top of it, which provides partial body weight support. A comfortable and minimally restrictive coupling interface embedded with a force/torque sensor allows to detect users' intentions, which are translated into command velocities by means of a variable admittance controller. An optimization technique based on users' preferences, i.e., Preference-Based Optimization (PBO) guides the choice of the admittance parameters (i.e., virtual mass and damping) to better fit subject-specific needs and characteristics. Experiments with twelve healthy subjects exhibited a significant decrease in energy consumption and jerk when using WANDER with PBO parameters as well as improved user performance and comfort. The great interpersonal variability in the optimized parameters highlights the importance of personalized control settings when walking with an assistive device, aiming to enhance users' comfort and mobility while ensuring reliable physical support. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sidewinding, a locomotion strategy characterized by the coordination of lateral and vertical body undulations, is frequently observed in rattlesnakes and has been successfully implemented by limbless robotic systems for effective movement across diverse terrestrial terrains. However, the integration of compliant mechanisms into sidewinding limbless robots remains less explored, posing challenges for navigation in complex, rheologically diverse environments. Inspired by a notable control simplification via mechanical intelligence in lateral undulation [1], which offloads feedback control to passive body mechanics and interactions with the environment, we present an innovative design of a mechanically intelligent limbless robot for sidewinding. This robot features a decentralized bilateral cable actuation system that resembles organismal muscle actuation mechanisms. We develop a feedforward controller that incorporates programmable body compliance into the sidewinding gait template. Our experimental results highlight the emergence of mechanical intelligence when the robot is equipped with an appropriate level of body compliance. This allows the robot to 1) locomote more energetically efficiently, as evidenced by a reduced cost of transport, and 2) navigate through terrain heterogeneities, all achieved in an open-loop manner, without the need for environmental awareness. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new variant of contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) called observation-augmented CMABs (OA-CMABs) wherein a robot uses extra outcome observations from an external information source, e.g. humans. In OA-CMABs, external observations are a function of context features and thus provide evidence on top of observed option outcomes to infer hidden parameters. However, if external data is error-prone, measures must be taken to preserve the correctness of inference. To this end, we derive a robust Bayesian inference process for OA-CMABs based on recently developed probabilistic semantic data association techniques, which handle complex mixture model parameter priors and hybrid discrete-continuous observation likelihoods for semantic external data sources. To cope with combined uncertainties in OA-CMABs, we also derive a new active inference algorithm for optimal option selection based on approximate expected free energy minimization. This generalizes prior work on CMAB active inference by accounting for faulty observations and non-Gaussian distributions. Results for a simulated deep space search site selection problem show that, even if incorrect semantic observations are provided externally, e.g. by scientists, efficient decision-making and robust parameter inference are still achieved in a wide variety of conditions. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this study, we propose a hierarchical motion intention prediction model for human-robot collaboration, in which the bottom level acquires human motion information, the middle level recognizes motion states and the high level predicts motion intentions. Compared with existing methods, our model fuses task-level human behavioral pattern prediction with instantaneous continuous motion intent decoding. Therefore, the robot controller can generate a collaborative trajectory in advance and adjust the key parameters (forces and velocities, etc.) in real time according to human motions. We quantitatively verify the proposed model with 10 subjects in the human-robot sawing task. The results show that the hierarchical model can effectively reduce human energy consumption and improve the average speed of the task. Meanwhile, subjective metrics indicate that subjects believe robots employing hierarchical models as capable of fostering improved cooperation and delivering greater assistance. Our study systematically proves that the proposed hierarchical model significantly enhanced the efficiency of human-robot co-manipulation, marking a step forward compared with existing works. Future studies will be focused on investigating more complex and general tasks. © 2016 IEEE.},

Tomographic tactile sensor based on resistive coupling is a novel contact pressure imaging method that allows the use of an arbitrary conductive material in a detector.

In this study, the relationship between the conductivity distribution of the material used as a detector and the sensing performance including sensitivity, force range, spatial resolution, and position accuracy is clarified to develop high-performance tomographic tactile sensors for specific purposes. The performance maps reveal that a material with a conductivity of approximately 0.2 S/m can serve as an effective detector for touch interactions involving a force range of several Newtons. Additionally, incorporating gradient conductivity in the cross section of the detector and multilayer conductive porous media with anisotropic conductive bonding can help expand the design flexibility for enhanced performance. Based on these findings, various tomographic tactile sensors for soft grippers, tangible input interfaces, flexible touch displays, and wearable electronics are demonstrated by using a conductive porous media. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robots contribute a significant part of smart living and production in modern society. Compared to rigid robots composed of hard materials soft pneumatic robotics constructed with flexible materials are more lightweight and flexible offering greater compliance environmental adaptability and safety when interacting with humans and fragile objects. Therefore they hold considerable promise in areas such as medical rehabilitation human-robot interaction and operations in unstructured complex environments. However existing soft pneumatic robots constructed from multi-directional and highly deformable membrane materials often suffer from issues such as low power-to-weight ratio complex control and fabrication processes and poor skin-friendliness. Textile materials as a category of typical fiber-based soft materials offer opportunities for multi-scale controllable structural design. They possess characteristics like a solid phase with the ability to smoothly deform with multiple curvatures and high strength combined with flexibility. Consequently they have the potential to enhance the power output controllability and applications of soft robots in the field of intelligent wearables. On this basis the multi-scale design strategy of textile structure was proposed in this study and textile-based soft actuators with excellent performance were developed so as to promote the practical applications of pneumatic actuators. In this study the mechanical properties of the knitted fabric layer of the textile-based actuators were characterized and the knitted layer with laying-in yarns and anisotropic mechanical behavior was designed to improve the actuating efficiency of the actuators. Furthermore a comparison was made between the bending curvatures of soft robotics made by conventional knitting-based actuators and modified knitting-based actuators with laying-in stitches. A modified knitted architecture with laying-in yarns was pioneered to fabricate textile-based actuators. The loop yarn of the modified knitted fabric possessed core-sheath structure by wrapping spandex filaments with polyester fibers so that high elasticity was achieved. The laying-in yarns were made of polyester fibers to endow the yarns with relatively low elasticity. The modified knitted fabric shows superanisotropic mechanical performance. Specifically the Young’ s modulus in the direction of laying-in yarns is up to 145 kPa while the Young’ s modulus in the orthogonal direction is only 1. 1 kPa. Such an isotropic mechanical property of the designed fabric enhances the deformation of the actuator along fabric’ s elastic direction but restricts the deformation in inelastic direction endowing the fabricated actuator with high energy efficiency and blocking forces. A large bending curvature of 0. 27 cm <sup>- 1</sup> is achieved under a low applied pressure 60 kPa . This bending actuation strain is much larger than that of actuators fabricated by conventional knitted fabrics. The multimode movements are achieved by programming the Young’ s modulus of the fabrics to form bending curling and coiling deformations. For the given size of the actuators the bending curvature of the actuators ranges from 0. 25 cm <sup>- 1</sup> to about 0. 13 cm <sup>- 1</sup> when the Young’ s modulus varies from 0. 05 MPa to 5. 6 MPa. Also the bending curvature can be tuned by the dimension of the actuators and a conical actuator can possess variable bending curvatures along its generatrix. The actuators can be used to assist arm motion displaying high specific work as indicated by the high actuation strain over 90° and high weight ratio between the arm weight 0. 225 kg and actuator weight 0. 019 kg . Moreover the actuators can also be assembled to produce soft grippers to grip and then lift objects by a sequence deformation of the actuators driven by a monotonous air pressure source and the gripping force can be easily tuned by controlling the supplied pressures. Unlike the conventional strategy to integrate different components into actuators a modified knitted architecture is used to fabricate actuators with superior actuation performance based on the hierarchical structure design of textiles. The proposed textile-based soft robotics fabricated based on the modified knitted fabric show a good bending actuation strain at low applied pressure a large blocking force and high specific work. Also the deformation of the actuators can be easily programmed by tuning the Young’ s modulus and dimensional size based on the hierarchical textile manufacturing process and thus the actuators possess low-cost and easy-fabrication features. The developed textile-based actuators are promising for diverse applications in soft robotics medical rehabilitation training soft gripper and other areas that are not possible with conventional linkage rigid actuators. This approach can be a paradigm to put forward structure innovation of textile-based actuators. © 2024 China Silk Association. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a climbing machining robot that can adsorb and move on the variable curvature surface of large and complex components to perform machining tasks. Active compliance suction units, which consist of twofold innovation, are proposed for this robot to overcome the bottleneck involving adsorption on the variable curvature surface. To solve the dilemma between high vacuum tolerance and surface compliance capability, we designed a novel trachea-inspired anisotropic stiffness sealing lip for the suction chamber, and it showed flexibility in the adsorption direction for adoption to complex surfaces and presented a high stiffness that can withstand large vacuum forces at its sides. Furthermore, to avoid vacuum leaks due to overstretching and overcompressing of the sealing lip, we developed an active compliance actuator to align the axis direction of the suction chamber with the normal direction of the adsorbed surface and maintain a suitable distance. To meeting strict weight and dimension demands, the actuator innovatively combines cable-driven units and 3-revolute-revolute-spherical parallel mechanism to reach a high load/weight ratio. The prototype of the climbing machining robot was developed and tested on a real large wind-turbine blade with variable curvatures ranging from 1 to 15 m. The experimental results show that the 10 kg-weight climbing machining robot with three ACSUs can provide over 1000 N adsorption force in total, and the fluctuation of adsorption forces can be reduced by 96% compared with that of robots with traditional pure passive compliance suction units. A comparative polishing experiment was executed on different curvature regions of the wind turbine blade, and the results prove that the proposed method can apply uniform polishing. In addition, a polishing-quality verification experiment was realized using the proposed climbing machining robot with a force-controlled polisher. These polishing experiments proved the machining capability of the proposed climbing robot. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

However, simultaneously manipulating a large extended object for a robot and human is a difficult task due to the inherent ambiguity in the desired motion. Our approach in this paper is to leverage data from human-human dyad experiments to determine motion intent for a physical human-robot co-manipulation task. We do this by showing that the human-human dyad data exhibits distinct torque triggers for a lateral movement. As an alternative intent estimation method, we also develop a deep neural network based on motion data from human-human trials to predict future trajectories based on past object motion. We then show how force and motion data can be used to determine robot control in a human-robot dyad. Finally, we compare human-human dyad performance to the performance of two controllers that we developed for human-robot co-manipulation.

	abstract = {The effectiveness of impedance control is significantly influenced by the appropriateness of the settings for impedance parameters. In This paper, a new multi-directional particle swarm optimization (MDPSO) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal impedance parameters for precise force tracking during the movement of industrial robot. Firstly, the position-based impedance controller between the industrial robot and its environment is established, and the difference of the contact force is used as input to the controller to obtain the desired trajectory. Then, enhancements to the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are introduced by adding additional optimization directions, thus developing multi-directional particle swarm optimization algorithm. The MDPSO algorithm determines the best individuals in terms of response speed, steady state error, oscillations and overshoot as additional directional data to improve the efficiency during the iterative process. Furthermore, the algorithm incorporates mutation operation on the particles to avoid falling into local optimum. The simulation results demonstrate that the MDPSO algorithm surpasses the traditional PSO algorithm in both convergence speed and accuracy. Additionally, experimental results show that excellent force tracking performance can be observed when the parameters derived from the MDPSO algorithm are applied for impedance controller. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To be fully integrated into the activities of our daily lives, robots need to be capable of traversing unstructured environments and interacting safely with their surroundings. Soft robots are perfect candidates since they can adapt to their surroundings through passive material compliance, rather than relying on complex control. However, the same compliance hinders the generation of propelling forces, and current approaches face a tradeoff between traveling speed, action range, and control complexity. We overcome this trade-off by developing a locomotion mechanism based on the synergistic interaction between symmetric vibrations, elasticity, and asymmetric morphology. We then realize a rapid soft locomotor using inexpensive off-the-shelf components and requiring only elementary actuation and control. A single robotic unit can travel at speeds up to 100 mm/s when tethered and 35 mm/s when untethered. We derive a model that predicts the speed of the robot as a function of several design parameters and physical properties, highlighting the role of geometric asymmetries in the resulting anisotropic motion. Moreover, these elementary units can be added together to create more complex behaviors. By adding 2 units in parallel, the assembly can locomote and be steered following nonholonomic constraints. Our approach opens the door to a new class of low-cost soft robots that can travel fast and far with elementary fabrication and control, and which can be combined to achieve complex functions without compromising their essential simplicity. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

We investigated the effects of external conditions (mobile surface roughness and excitation waveform) and internal conditions (geometric parameters of driving legs) on the locomotory modes. The millirobot achieved a step resolution of 2 μm in the micromotion and maximum mobile velocity of 800 mm/s in the macromotion.

	abstract = {Soft robots can adapt to dynamic environments without prior knowledge of their properties. Plants inspire mechanisms for counterbalancing dynamic loads by locally modulating compliance through anisotropic humidity-responsive materials and structures. In addition to well-known passive bilayers, plants may also actively control swelling. The combination of robust hygroscopic material-level response and simple electrical control makes active swelling particularly attractive for technological implementation. However, dynamic swelling demands the development and optimisation of congruent pumping solutions. This work suggests electrohydrodynamic pumping, enabled by highly reversible ion immobilisation at capacitive electrodes, as a particularly suitable low-pressure, high-area liquid displacement solution for active swelling. Local pore fill ratio (PFR) modulation is used as a measure for dynamic liquid displacement and swelling. A method for highly localised (10 μm membrane thickness) assessment of the dynamic variation of PFR in a 400 μm laminate undergoing cross-plane electrokinetic liquid displacement is developed. Two modes for transient PFR modulation were identified: electrokinetic ion transfer and diffusive solvent redistribution, pronounced at high and low voltage scan rates, respectively. The strategic combination of these modes enables various compliance-modulation scenarios. The system contains (within a cycle) a constant amount of liquid in an open network of liquid-filled pores. 30%-75% PFR yielded the highest dynamic PFR modulation: a high amount of empty pores is beneficial, yet a too-low PFR compromises the continuous liquid pathway necessary for electrokinetic pumping. The dynamic nature of internal liquid rearrangement was characterised by relatively fast electrokinetics-driven fluxes (6.3% PFR change in 80 s), followed by a slow equilibration of concentration and PFR. At high scan rates, PFR decreased at positive polarisation, while both positive and negative polarity yielded a similar decrease at low scan rates (5 mV s<sup>−1</sup>). Localised control over the swelling gradient enables the design of systems that morphologically adapt to complex dynamic loading conditions. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Intuitive and comfortable physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) can be realized by changing impedance/admittance parameters corresponding to human interaction. However, this dynamic adjustment may result in drastically changed system dynamics, which usually give rise to system instability. We introduce a power envelope regulation strategy designed to constrain the variability of admittance parameters, thereby ensuring system passivity and mitigating the risk of instability. Then, sliding mode control (SMC) is employed to yield stable and robust performance. A new sliding surface is proposed based on feedback linearization, which shows improved tracking performance and stability compared to a conventional sliding surface. The effectiveness of the proposed sliding surface and associated control is theoretically validated. Notably, our modified sliding surface works universally, regardless of the order of the desired admittance equation. The trade-off between system chattering and robustness is effectively managed using a variable–boundary approach, which dynamically adjusts system constraints to optimize performance. In addition, a control algorithm combining acceleration feedback and sliding mode is proposed, showing improved robustness and tracking accuracy performance compared with applying the proposed SMC algorithm exclusively. The efficacy of these methodologies is substantiated through numerical simulations and empirical experiments. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The development of the field of soft robotics has led to the exploration of novel techniques to manufacture soft actuators, which provide distinct advantages for wearable assistive robotics. One subset of these soft pneumatic actuators is conventionally developed from silicone, fabrics, and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Each of these materials in isolation possesses limitations of low-stress capacity, low-design complexity, and high-input pressure requirements, respectively. Combining these materials can overcome some limitations and maintain their desirable properties. In this article, we explore one such composite design scheme using a combination of silicone polymer-based bladder and reconfigurable fabric skin made from an anisotropic extensible fabric. The silicone polymer bladder acts as the hermetic seal, while this skin acts as the constraint. Bending and torsional actuators were designed utilizing the anisotropy of these fabrics. The torsional actuator designs can achieve over 540° of twist, significantly larger than previously reported in the literature, owing to the lower mechanical impedance of the extensible fabrics. Actuators with 360° of bending were also fabricated using this method. In addition, the lack of TPU-backed or inextensible fabrics reduces the actuator’s stiffness, leading to lower actuation pressures. Skin-based designs also confer the advantage of modularity, reconfigurability, and the ability to achieve complex motions by tuning the properties of the bladder and the skin. For applications with high-force requirements, such as wearable exoskeletons, we demonstrate the utility of multilayer design schemes. A multilayer bending actuator generated 190 N of force at 100 kPa and was shown to be a candidate for wearable assistive devices. In addition, torsional designs were shown to have utility in practical scenarios such as screwing on a bottle cap and turning knobs. Thus, we present a novel fabric-skin-based design concept that is highly versatile and customizable for various application requirements. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Human–robot handover has a huge impact on human–robot interaction. For current research on human–robot handover, special attention is paid to robot path planning and motion control during the handover process; seldom is research focused on human handover intentions. However, enabling robots to predict human handover intentions is important for improving the efficiency of object handover. To enable robots to predict human handover intentions, a novel human handover intention prediction approach was proposed in this study. In the proposed approach, a wearable data glove and fuzzy rules are firstly used to achieve faster and accurate human handover intention sensing (HIS) and human handover intention prediction (HIP). This approach mainly includes human handover intention sensing (HIS) and human handover intention prediction (HIP). For human HIS, we employ wearable data gloves to sense human handover intention information. Compared with vision-based and physical contact-based sensing, wearable data glove-based sensing cannot be affected by visual occlusion and does not pose threats to human safety. For human HIP, we propose a fast handover intention prediction method based on fuzzy rules. Using this method, the robot can efficiently predict human handover intentions based on the sensing data obtained by the data glove. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages and efficacy of the proposed method in human intention prediction during human–robot handover. © 2023 by the authors.},

Moreover, we develop an algorithm for multi-slave setups to estimate the object stiffness and motion uncertainty in the direction of the internal command force according to Lyapunov theory. Finally, the impedance control generates a reference trajectory for the multi-slave to maintain the desired internal force and track the master’s motion. Several experiments were conducted on a self-made robot. The experimental results show that the oscillation amplitude of each slave end is less than 1 mm and the directional oscillation amplitude is less than 1 degree during the tracking of the desired commanded internal force. For objects with a low stiffness, the error of the commanded internal force is less than 1 N (6%) per slave. The error in tracking the commanded internal force for objects with a high stiffness is less than 2 N (8%).

	abstract = {Confined space searches such as pipeline inspections are widely demanded in various scenarios, where lightweight soft robots with inherent compliance to adapt to unstructured environments exhibit good potential. We proposed a tubular soft robot with a simple structure of a spring-rolled dielectric elastomer (SRDE) and compliant passive bristles. Due to the compliance of the bristles, the proposed robots can work in pipelines with inner diameters both larger and smaller than the one of the bristles. Firstly, the nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the SRDE were investigated experimentally. Then, we fabricated the proposed robot with a bristle diameter of 19 mm and then studied its performance in pipelines on the ground with inner diameters of 18 mm and 20 mm. When the pipeline’s inner diameter was less than the outer diameter of the bristles, the bristles remained in the state of bending and the robot locomotion is mainly due to anisotropic friction (1.88 and 0.88 body lengths per second horizontally and vertically, respectively, in inner diameter of 18 mm and 0.06 body length per second in that of 16 mm). In the case of the pipeline with the larger inner diameter, the bristles were not fully constrained, and a small bending moment applied on the lower bristle legs contributed to the robot’s locomotion, leading to a high velocity (2.78 body lengths per second in 20 mm diameter acrylic pipe). In addition, the robot can work in varying geometries, such as curving pipes (curve radius ranges from 0.11 m to 0.31 m) at around two body lengths per second horizontally and on the ground at 3.52 body lengths per second, showing promise for pipeline or narrow space inspections. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study explains how the leader-follower relationship and turn-taking could develop in a dyadic imitative interaction by conducting robotic simulation experiments based on the free energy principle. Our prior study showed that introducing a parameter during the model training phase can determine leader and follower roles for subsequent imitative interactions. The parameter is defined as (Formula presented.), the so-called meta-prior, and is a weighting factor used to regulate the complexity term versus the accuracy term when minimizing the free energy. This can be read as sensory attenuation, in which the robot’s prior beliefs about action are less sensitive to sensory evidence. The current extended study examines the possibility that the leader-follower relationship shifts depending on changes in (Formula presented.) during the interaction phase. We identified a phase space structure with three distinct types of behavioral coordination using comprehensive simulation experiments with sweeps of (Formula presented.) of both robots during the interaction. Ignoring behavior in which the robots follow their own intention was observed in the region in which both (Formula presented.) s were set to large values. One robot leading, followed by the other robot was observed when one (Formula presented.) was set larger and the other was set smaller. Spontaneous, random turn-taking between the leader and the follower was observed when both (Formula presented.) s were set at smaller or intermediate values. Finally, we examined a case of slowly oscillating (Formula presented.) in anti-phase between the two agents during the interaction. The simulation experiment resulted in turn-taking in which the leader-follower relationship switched during determined sequences, accompanied by periodic shifts of (Formula presented.) s. An analysis using transfer entropy found that the direction of information flow between the two agents also shifted along with turn-taking. Herein, we discuss qualitative differences between random/spontaneous turn-taking and agreed-upon sequential turn-taking by reviewing both synthetic and empirical studies. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper presents UPed, a quadruped robot platform, for studying passive, directional, leg compliance in robots. This work was motivated by the benefits provided by passively and directionally compliant legs in humans and animals. UPed uses under-actuated legs based on the bent-knee model which is capable of changing the direction and magnitude of the leg compliance by adjusting the knee angle and distal leg stiffness. Pneumatic pistons were chosen as variable compliance elements, enabling the leg compliance to be adjusted during locomotion. The platform was validated experimentally by evaluating how the robot's pitch rate and cost of transport changed with variations in leg compliance and knee angle. Results of these experiments indicated that significant performance improvements are possible by selecting appropriate values of compliance and knee angle. They also demonstrated a unique capability to explore adjustable directional compliance and other parameters in robot legs on a physical robotic system. UPed has the potential to facilitate significant performance improvements of legged robots by enabling additional in-depth studies on directional passive leg compliance. © 2022 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Children naturally engage in pretend play with others in their daily life. The children share each other's expectations toward objects and people around them. Such expectation-sharing can be considered the fundamental process of social communication, where we exchange beliefs, desires, and intentions. Firstly, the present paper examines some cases of such expectation-sharing in pretend play observed in our longitudinal robot-mediated interaction with 27 preschoolers (3-to-4-year-olds) at a kindergarten. The robot, which the researchers in another room remotely controlled, has a simple appearance and motion to accept various expectations from the children. The robot functioned as a pivot for the children to exchange each other's expectations towards the robot, toys, and people. The children might bring expectations incongruent with each other, but such expectations gradually converged into a consistent one, on which they understood each other's verbal and non-verbal actions. Secondly, this paper interprets and models these cases using the predictive coding theory. According to the theory, the children project their predictions onto the shared environment and update the predictions by minimizing the error against reality. This act of projection, which was performed as labeling (e.g., a block as a rice ball) or pretend action (e.g., feeding it to the robot) by the children, is a form of active inference to modify the environment to match the prediction. The children exchanged and coordinated their predictions through visible action collectively accumulated in the playing environment around the robot. We conclude that joint prediction is the fundamental process of social communication, where we coordinate each other's behavior for collaboration. © 2023 IEEE.},

Soft crawling robots may be widely applied to travel across complex environment, such as post-disaster search and rescue, environmental exploration, medical surgery, and so on. Soft crawling robots can move forward through elongating and contracting their bodies, but the smooth body surfaces like silicone material have limited their speed of movement. In nature, soft animals use their scales or setae to increase friction anisotropy and propel their bodies forward. Using biologically-inspired skin is an recognized way to increase the movement speed of soft crawling robots effectively. The directionality of the snake scales can produce anisotropic friction with the ground when moving forward, which is necessary to promote the movement of the snake. Inspired by snake scales, we developed a hard scale structure that can be fixed to the bottom of the pneumatic actuators. These scales can generate friction force when in contact with the substrate surface, which increases the speed of this soft crawling robot. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an admittance control with a variable center of mass (COM) for a power-assisted omnidirectional cart. This power-assist system works by an admittance control using operation forces measured by the force-sensing handle consisting of load cells. To realize the admittance control, the virtual mass/inertia is defined with dynamic parameters such as mass, inertia, damping coefficients, and the location information. The behavior of the virtual mass/inertia is determined by the relative position between the force-applied point and the location of the virtual mass/inertia. Therefore, we propose a variable COM control method in which the optimal position of COM is determined automatically depending on the operation mode for improving the maneuverability of the omnidirectional cart. To evaluate the proposed control method, a series of experiments were conducted by using the prototype of an omnidirectional cart with active caster drive mechanisms. From the results of the experiments, the optimal COMs for pulling, pushing forward, pushing lateral, turning on the spot, and pushing in a curve were determined independently. Finally, running experiments were performed by the control system with the running pattern detection and automatic COM switching function. It was confirmed that the proposed control system was successfully installed on the prototype cart and its maneuverability was improved. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The compliance nature of soft robots permits them to effectively adapt to various challenging environments, but at the cost of poor payload carrying capabilities and lack of precision in motions. Electro-adhesive (EA) layer jamming clutches are an emerging type of active variable stiffness (VS) technique that features the advantages of structural simplicity, light-weight, rapid response speed, and low power consumption. However, current EA clutches mainly adopt a planar configuration, despite the large stiffness variations in tensional direction, they fail to exhibit effective stiffness variations in compression and bending directions due to the planar structures. To address this drawback, a novel corrugated EA clutch is proposed in this work to realize multi-directional VS. Its VS performances in tension, compression, and bending directions are benchmarked against a widely studied planar EA clutch and the effects of actuation voltage amplitude are investigated experimentally. The proposed corrugated EA clutch can effectively increase the brake forces when activated by 25, 23 and 8 folds in tension, compression and bending directions, respectively. To demonstrate its applications in soft robotics, a novel origami gripper with excellent adaptability is proposed by utilizing the corrugated EA clutch, and successful grasping on objects with various weights and morphologies is demonstrated. © 2023 IEEE.},

The rotation of the robot's wheel was controlled using brakes fabricated from DN gel. DN gel is a unique material that exhibits a frictional difference in surface upon voltage application. The directional crawling of the inchworm robot was possible through appropriate activation of DN gel brakes exploiting the property of surface friction. The brakes are in constant contact with the wheel's axle and impress high and low friction upon voltage application to control the rotation. The control of rolling friction of the wheels results in improved locomotion capabilities and higher speeds compared to inchworm robots that employ sliding friction and body peristalsis. A mathematical model was developed to evaluate the theoretical displacement of the inchworm robot. The system is characterized by low power consumption, tough but soft brake material with good elasticity, low cost, and easy to fabricate with inherent compliance. The DN gel can be fabricated from special 3D printers which makes the whole robot completely 3D printable. © 2023 IEEE.},

However, it is difficult to simultaneously handle the various constraints which are described in different space. In this research, a control framework is proposed for solving the problem of robotic constraints avoidance based on virtual fixtures and adaptive admittance control. Specifically, different constraints are evaluated by geometric distances and redescribed as potential fields in Cartesian space. Then, a virtual repulsive force is generated with considering operator's intention to drive robot away from the constraint areas. Furtherly, an adaptive admittance controller is constructed to ensure the stability of system. Simulations are conducted on AUBO I5 robots under three scenarios and the effectiveness of the proposed framework in handling robot's self-collision, workspace collision, configuration singularity and joint-limit violation is verified. © 2023 IEEE.},

To this purpose, human intention is defined as the desired trajectory that the human wants to follow over a finite rolling prediction horizon so that the robot can assist in pursuing it. This work investigates a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cascaded with a Fully Connected layer. In particular, we propose an iterative training procedure to adapt the model. Such an iterative procedure is powerful in reducing the prediction error. Still, it has the drawback that it is time-consuming and does not generalize to different users or different co-manipulated objects. To overcome this issue, Transfer Learning (TL) adapts the pre-trained model to new trajectories, users, and co-manipulated objects by freezing the LSTM layer and fine-tuning the last FC layer, which makes the procedure faster. Experiments show that the iterative procedure adapts the model and reduces prediction error. Experiments also show that TL adapts to different users and to the co-manipulation of a large object. Finally, to check the utility of adopting the proposed method, we compare the proposed controller enhanced by the intention prediction with the other two standard controllers of pHRI. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The safety-critical nature of vehicle steering is one of the main motivations for exploring the space of possible cyber-physical attacks against the steering systems of modern vehicles. This paper investigates the adversarial capabilities for destabilizing the interaction dynamics between human drivers and vehicle haptic shared control (HSC) steering systems. In contrast to the conventional robotics literature, where the main objective is to render the human-automation interaction dynamics stable by ensuring passivity, this paper takes the exact opposite route. In particular, to investigate the damaging capabilities of a successful cyber-physical attack, this paper demonstrates that an attacker who targets the HSC steering system can destabilize the interaction dynamics between the human driver and the vehicle HSC steering system through synthesis of time-varying impedance profiles. Specifically, it is shown that the adversary can utilize a properly designed non-passive and time-varying adversarial impedance target dynamics, which are fed with a linear combination of the human driver and the steering column torques. Using these target dynamics, it is possible for the adversary to generate in realtime a reference angular command for the driver input device and the directional control steering assembly of the vehicle. Furthermore, it is shown that the adversary can make the steering wheel and the vehicle steering column angular positions to follow the reference command generated by the time-varying impedance target dynamics using proper adaptive control strategies. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of such time-varying impedance attacks, which result in a non-passive and inherently unstable interaction between the driver and the HSC steering system. © 2023 IEEE.},

Eye gaze-based control interfaces offer a non-invasive way to infer intent and reduce the cognitive burden on operators of complex robots. Eye gaze is traditionally used for 'gaze triggering' (GT) in which staring at an object, or sequence of objects, triggers pre-programmed robotic movements. We propose an alternative approach: a neural network-based 'action prediction' (AP) mode that extracts gaze-related features to recognize, and often predict, an operator's intended action primitives. We integrated the AP mode into a shared autonomy framework capable of 3D gaze reconstruction, real-time intent inference, object localization, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic trajectory planning. Using this framework, we conducted a user study to directly compare the performance of the GT and AP modes using traditional subjective performance metrics, such as Likert scales, as well as novel objective performance metrics, such as the delay of recognition. Statistical analyses suggested that the AP mode resulted in more seamless robotic movement than the state-of-the-art GT mode, and that participants generally preferred the AP mode. © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

Many rehabilitation and assessment tasks, for which THINGER is designed, are improved by rendering near-zero impedance during physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). To achieve this goal, the presented impedance controller includes several novel features. First, a reference trajectory is omitted, allowing free movements. Second, force-feedback gains are reduced near actuator limits and a saturation function limits the maximum commanded force; both allow more responsive (higher) force-feedback gains within the workspace and mitigate transient oscillations caused by external disturbances. Finally, manipulability-based directional force-feedback gains help improve rendered impedance isotropy. Validation experiments included free exploration of the workspace, following a prescribed circular thumb motion, and intentional exposure to external disturbances. The experimental results show that the presented impedance controller significantly reduces impedance to subject-initiated motion and accurately renders the desired isotropic low-impedance environment. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Assisting persons during physical therapy or augmenting their performance often requires precise delivery of an intervention. Robotic devices are perfectly placed to do so, but their intervention highly depends on the physical human-robot connection. The inherent compliance in the connection leads to delays and losses in bi-directional power transmission and can lead to human-robot joint axes misalignment. This is often neglected in the literature by assuming a rigid connection and has a negative impact on the intervention's effectiveness and robustness. This paper presents the preliminary results of a study that aims to close that gap. The study investigates what model forms and parameters best capture human-robot connection dynamics across different persons, connection designs (cuffs), and cuff strapping pressures. The results show that the linear spring-damper model is the best compromise, but its parameters must be adjusted for each individual and different conditions separately. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A robot aided system for root canal therapy was developed, which realized image registration, intra-operative visual navigation, human-robot cooperative compliance control and robot drilling safety constraints. First, image registration includes two parts: using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to register the point cloud of Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) image and oral scanning image, and using the method based on feature points to register the oral scanning model and visual space. Then, the transformation from the robot flange frame to the dental drill frame was obtained through robot hand-eye calibration, and the image space was connected to the visual space using a binocular vision system, thus realizing visual navigation. Finally, the admittance control was used to guide the robot to locate the root canal orifice, and a linear virtual fixture was applied to constrain the drilling direction. The results of surgical navigation experiment and model drilling experiment show that the image registration error is less than 1mm, the robot drilling position error is less than 1 mm, and the angle error is about 5 degrees, which meets the clinical accuracy requirements. © 2023 IEEE.},

Haptic sensing for tooltip can reduce the chance of complications in such procedures, such as vessel irritation, vasospasm, perforation, and aneurysm rupture. This paper investigates the design of an affordable multi-directional micro force and tactile sensor by comparing two sensing modalities: (i) Electrical Impedance sensing (EIS) via tissue impedance and electrical noise measurement, and (ii) Force Sensitive Resistance (FSR) measurement. For both of these techniques, we successfully developed two bi-directional sensor sleeves that were designed to envelope cannulas of varying dimensional configurations. In in-vitro phantom experiments with realistic mechanical and electrical proprieties, We showcased that the proposed designs have the potential to be used as an affordable disposable multi-modal bi-directional tactile and force sensor for off-the-shelf vascular intervention catheters. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)-based robotic tactile sensing holds great promise for future robot technology by geometrical scalability, mechanical durability, and ease of fabrication. The current EIT-based approach demonstrates wide success in measuring distributed normal tactile stimuli by reconstructing the scalar of the electrical conductivity. As an advancement, we propose a theoretical investigation on measuring conductivity tensor distribution using EIT, empowered by the deep neural network, that would facilitate a multi-modal tactile measurement on both the normal and shear inputs. An architecture based on Convolutional neural network and spatial sensitivity awareness on the loss function demonstrates the high-performing nonlinear tensor reconstruction that yet has not been proposed to date. Along with a sim-to-real approach for extensive investigation on conductivity tensor combinations, computationally efficient and robust (well-posed) model training was achieved, which results in a generalized reconstruction capability. Extensive simulation studies on reconstruction accuracy, noise robustness, and generalized reconstruction capability are presented. This preliminary investigation would be a substantial basis for constructing a new type of tactile sensor measuring distributed multi-modal tactile sensing. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is evolving and being used in industrial simulations, but the possibility to touch objects is missing, for example, to judge the perceived quality in the design of a car. Current haptic interfaces do not make it possible to easily restore texture, therefore an approach is considered as an intermittent contact interface to achieve this. A cobot places a moving surface at the point of contact with a virtual object in order to enable physical contact with the hand of the operator. This paper aims to speak about several challenges: the placement of the robot, the modeling of the operator, the management of the displacement and the speed of the robot, and the detection of the operator’s intentions. The placement of the robot is chosen to allow reaching the different working areas and to ensure passive safety by making it impossible for the robot to hit the head and chest of the operator in a normal working position, i.e. sitting in a chair. A user model, consisting of a torso and arms, is designed and tested to track the user’s movements in real-time. Interaction is possible with a set of pre-defined poses that the user follows together as desired. Various strategies are proposed to predict the intent of the user. The main aspects of prediction are based on the direction of the eye and the position of the hand of the user. An experimental study as well as the resulting analysis demonstrates the contribution by considering the direction of the gaze. The advantage of introducing “safety” points to move the robot away from the operator and allow rapid movements of the robot is emphasized. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Estimation of dynamic uncertainties is a critical and fundamental problem when designing a control system for a robot. During robot-environment interaction, in addition to the internal dynamic model uncertainties, the external environment-exerted force will also enter the dynamics. For robot impedance control, an exact dynamic model of the robot is needed but usually not available. It has been shown that integrating an impedance controller with a disturbance observer can achieve accurate impedance control. However, it works only for robots in free motion but not robot-environment interaction. Although a disturbance observer is able to accurately estimate the dynamic uncertainties, the estimation is lumped uncertainties that contain all uncertainty sources including both the internal and the external disturbances. Without separating these two parts, the method of combining an impedance controller and an observer will result in the human-applied force being canceled instead of interacting with the robot. To solve this problem in this paper, we propose a framework for learning the internal disturbances and separating the external disturbances by integrating three entities: an impedance controller, a neural network (NN) model, and a disturbance observer. In the framework, the impedance controller provides compliant robot behavior, while the observer captures the lumped uncertainties, and the NN learns to separate the external disturbances. Simulation results of an application scenario with an obstructive virtual fixture demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Fine assembly tasks such as electrical connector insertion have tight tolerances and sensitive components, limiting the speed and robustness of robot assembly, even when using vision, tactile, or force sensors. Connector insertion is a common industrial task, requiring horizontal alignment errors to be compensated with minimal force, then sufficient force to be brought in the insertion direction. The ability to handle a variety of objects, achieve high-speeds, and handle a wide range in object position variation are also desired. Soft grippers can allow the gripping of parts with variation in surface geometry, but often focus on gripping alone and may not be able to bring the assembly forces required. To achieve high-speed connector insertion, this paper proposes monolithic fingers with structured compliance and form-closure features. A finray-effect gripper is adapted to realize structured (i.e. directional) stiffness that allows high-speed mechanical search, self-alignment in insertion, and sufficient assembly force. The design of the finray ribs and fingertips are investigated, with a final design allowing plug insertion with a tolerance window of up to 7.5 mm at high speed. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Creating autonomous robots that can actively explore the environment, acquire knowledge and learn skills continuously is the ultimate achievement envisioned in cognitive and developmental robotics. Importantly, if the aim is to create robots that can continuously develop through interactions with their environment, their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e. controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in AI and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The compliant nature of vine robots, or everted tubes, makes them very useful for passively navigating sensitive and cluttered environments. Like many soft robots, their compliance makes kinematic modeling difficult. This work seeks to validate the assumption that everted tubes can be modeled as an inflated cantilever beam. The tip deflection and curvature of tubes constructed from Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) and commercially available silicone coated nylon, two commonly used materials for everted tube robots, were measured under several different loading conditions in both everted and non-everted configurations. Our data show that everted tubes constructed from LDPE can be modeled with Comer's model for inflated isotropic beams, which has been assumed in recent literature. In contrast, this model did not fit the silicone coated nylon beams' behavior. This is because of the anisotropic properties of fabric the current model does not consider. Results also showed that everted tubes collapsed before the modeled maximum loading condition at a constant tip displacement, whereas uneverted tubes collapsed slightly after the modeled maximum load. From the inflated beam model, we present an iterative approach to computing the forward kinematics of an everted tube in contact with an obstacle within an environment. This allows for estimating contact forces and determining the static pose of an everted tube. © 2023 IEEE.},

However, in robot control, moving an arm’s end-effector to a target position or along a target trajectory requires accurate forward and inverse models. Here we show that by learning the transition (forward) model from interaction, we can use it to drive the learning of an amortized policy. Hence, we revisit policy optimization in relation to the deep active inference framework and describe a modular neural network architecture that simultaneously learns the system dynamics from prediction errors and the stochastic policy that generates suitable continuous control commands to reach a desired reference position. We evaluated the model by comparing it against the baseline of a linear quadratic regulator, and conclude with additional steps to take toward human-like motor control. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Our approach allows the full control of the co-carrying trajectories by the person while sharing the load with multiple robots depending on the size and the weight of the object. This is achieved by merging the haptic information transferred through the object and the human motion information obtained from a motion capture system. One important advantage of the framework is that no strict internal communication is required between the robots, regardless of the object size and deformation characteristics. We validate the framework with two challenging real-world scenarios: co-transportation of a wooden rigid closet and a bulky box on top of forklift moving straps, with the latter characterizing deformable objects. In order to evaluate the generalizability of the proposed framework, a heterogenous team of two mobile manipulators that consist of an Omni-directional mobile base and a collaborative robotic arm with different DoFs is chosen for the experiments. The qualitative comparison between our controller and the baseline controller (i.e., an admittance controller) during these experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework especially when co-carrying deformable objects. Furthermore, we believe that the performance of our framework during the experiment with the lifting straps offers a promising solution for the co-transportation of bulky and ungraspable objects. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An accurate estimation of rotational effects is critical during the preliminary design of wind turbines. For this purpose, different stall delay models were developed based on the centrifugal pumping mechanism. However, their generality is not yet thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we investigated the causal relationship between the radial flow, the pressure reduction, and forces augmentation. Three stall delay models, which represent different solutions of the centrifugal pumping mechanism, were verified and modified to accurately predict the radial flow, the pressure coefficient, and normal and tangential force coefficients. Then, the three modified stall delay models were calibrated using radial flow data available from the literature. Finally, they were validated against the experimental data of the NREL phase VI and MEXICO rotors. The results showed that the centrifugal pumping produces a small chordwise pressure gradient in the separated boundary layer, which produces a small augmentation in the normal and tangential force coefficients. In contrast, the measured pressure coefficient and the normal and tangential force coefficients showed a large augmentation compared to the three modified stall delay models. Consequently, the lack of generality of current stall delay models is mainly due to the centrifugal pumping assumption. Furthermore, the verification and calibration of these stall delay models allowed us to isolate large errors in the model's output due to the model's assumptions. Thus, the importance of a rigorous verification and calibration before performing the validation. © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Concepts that draw inspiration from soft biological tissues have enabled significant advances in creating artificial materials for a range of applications, such as dry adhesives, tissue engineering, biointegrated electronics, artificial muscles, and soft robots. Many biological tissues, represented by muscles, exhibit directionally dependent mechanical and electrical properties. However, equipping synthetic materials with tissue-like mechanical and electrical anisotropies remains challenging. Here, we present the bioinspired concepts, design principles, numerical modeling, and experimental demonstrations of soft elastomer composites with programmed mechanical and electrical anisotropies, as well as their integrations with active functionalities. Mechanically assembled, 3D structures of polyimide serve as skeletons to offer anisotropic, nonlinear mechanical properties, and crumpled conductive surfaces provide anisotropic electrical properties, which can be used to construct bioelectronic devices. Finite element analyses quantitatively capture the key aspects that govern mechanical anisotropies of elastomer composites, providing a powerful design tool. Incorporation of 3D skeletons of thermally responsive polycaprolactone into elastomer composites allows development of an active artificial material that can mimic adaptive mechanical behaviors of skeleton muscles at relaxation and contraction states. Furthermore, the fabrication process of anisotropic elastomer composites is compatible with dielectric elastomer actuators, indicating potential applications in humanoid artificial muscles and soft robots. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Soft robots made from soft materials show great advantages over rigid robots in environmental adaptability and motion flexibility. However, too soft body makes them lose the load capacity, which limits their applications in locomotion. Although the crawling tensegrity robots with both rigid bars and flexible cables are potential to address this challenge, the existing inchworm friction drive methods are difficult to realize the motion of a single tensegrity unit. Besides, the lack of appropriate soft actuators and robot configuration also blocks the development of the crawling tensegrity robots. This article presents a new inchworm driving method realized by the inclined supporting feet. By using the twisted artificial muscle (TAM) as actuator, the combination of the TAM and the inclined supporting feet endows a single three-bar tensegrity unit with multimotion capacity and anisotropic stiffness characteristics. The designed tensegrity robot not only has high compliance but also displays high stiffness, which endows it with high load capacity. The prototype can carry a load of 150 g (7.5 times of its weight) to achieve straight and turning motions. This article provides a design idea for the crawling tensegrity robot and a theoretical foundation for improving the load capacity of high compliance robots. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), patients and surgeons benefit from a reduced incision size and dexterous instruments. However, current robotic surgery platforms lack haptic feedback, which is an essential element of safe operation. Moreover, teleportation control challenges make complex surgical tasks like suturing more time-consuming than those that use manual tools. This paper presents a new force-sensing instrument that semi-automates the suturing task and facilitates teleoperated robotic manipulation. In order to generate the ideal needle insertion trajectory and pass the needle through its curvature, the end-effector mechanism has a rotating degree of freedom. Impedance control was used to provide sensory information about needle–tissue interaction forces to the operator using an indirect force estimation approach based on data-based models. The operator’s motion commands were then regulated using a hyperplanar virtual fixture (VF) designed to maintain the desired distance between the end-effector and tissue surface while avoiding unwanted contact. To construct the geometry of the VF, an optoelectronic sensor-based approach was developed. Based on the experimental investigation of the hyperplane VF methodology, improved needle–tissue interaction force, manipulation accuracy, and task completion times were demonstrated. Finally, experimental validation of the trained force estimation models and the perceived interaction forces by the user was conducted using online data, demonstrating the potential of the developed approach in improving task performance. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for real-time classification of subtasks in a physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) task involving contact with a stiff environment. In this regard, we consider three subtasks for a given pHRI task: Idle, Driving, and Contact. Based on this classification, the parameters of an admittance controller that regulates the interaction between human and robot are adjusted adaptively in real time to make the robot more transparent to the operator (i.e. less resistant) during the Driving phase and more stable during the Contact phase. The Idle phase is primarily used to detect the initiation of task. Experimental results have shown that the ANN model can learn to detect the subtasks under different admittance controller conditions with an accuracy of 98% for 12 participants. Finally, we show that the admittance adaptation based on the proposed subtask classifier leads to 20% lower human effort (i.e. higher transparency) in the Driving phase and 25% lower oscillation amplitude (i.e. higher stability) during drilling in the Contact phase compared to an admittance controller with fixed parameters. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Access to graphical information plays a very significant role in today’s world. Access to this information can be particularly limiting for individuals who are blind or visually impaired (BVIs). In this work, we present the design of a low-cost, mobile tactile display that also provides robotic assistance/guidance using haptic virtual fixtures in a shared control paradigm to aid in tactile diagram exploration. This work is part of a larger project intended to improve the ability of BVI users to explore tactile graphics on refreshable displays (particularly exploration time and cognitive load) through the use of robotic assistance/guidance. The particular focus of this paper is to share information related to the design and development of an affordable and compact device that may serve as a solution towards this overall goal. The proposed system uses a small omni-wheeled robot base to allow for smooth and unlimited movements in the 2D plane. Sufficient position and orientation accuracy is obtained by using a low-cost dead reckoning approach that combines data from an optical mouse sensor and inertial measurement unit. A low-cost force-sensing system and an admittance control model are used to allow shared control between the Cobot and the user, with the addition of guidance/virtual fixtures to aid in diagram exploration. Preliminary semi-structured interviews, with four blind or visually impaired participants who were allowed to use the Cobot, found that the system was easy to use and potentially useful for exploring virtual diagrams tactually. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Human intention adaptation is usually realized by changing impedance/admittance parameters according to human interaction in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). However, determining which admittance parameters need to be updated and how to update depends on the context of pHRI and system stability. This paper aims to provide a systematic study for all three admittance parameters considering human intention adaptation and system passivity for ensuring an intuitive and safe pHRI. For intuitiveness, a general human intention framework based on the robot's roles is summarized as a premise for designing human intention-oriented updating rules for admittance parameters. For the changing trends of these parameters (i.e., increasing or decreasing), only those impacting system passivity are studied. A power envelope regulation (PER) concept is then proposed to impose constraints on variable admittance parameters inferred from human intention for maintaining safe interaction. Our initial results suggest that the passivity condition is not a sufficient condition for system stability in pHRI, whereas preserving the power envelope inferred from the passivity condition can maintain passivity as well as avoid mismatch of admittance parameters arising from unpredicted human interaction. As a result, drastic changes in admittance controller dynamics, which usually result in instability, are restrained. The effectiveness of our approaches not only to maintain intuitive interaction but also to preserve passivity is validated via numerical simulation and experiments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

To demonstrate the proposed model and its effectiveness in simplified kinematics, this paper only targets a SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm)-type robot. The proposed model includes not only link length errors and rotary axis angular offsets, widely known as the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters, but also the “error map” of the angular positioning deviation of each rotary axis, modelled as a function of command angular position, and the rotation direction to model the influence of backlash. The angular positioning deviation of each rotary axis is identified by measuring the robots end-effector position by a laser tracker with indexing each rotary axis at prescribed angular positions. To verify the validity of the identified model, the effectiveness of the compensation based on it is experimentally investigated. By the compensation, the robot’s average absolute position error was reduced by 33% to 0.034mm. Furthermore, this paper experimentally demonstrates that the proposed model can be extended to the radial error motion, axis-to-axis cross talk, and the three-dimensional positioning with orientation errors of axis average lines. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Our purpose was to investigate whether liver stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment planning can be harmonized across different treatment planning systems, delivery techniques, and institutions by using a specific prescription method and to minimize the knowledge gap concerning intersystem and interuser differences. We provide best practice guidelines for all used techniques. Methods and Materials: A multiparametric specification of target dose (gross target volume [GTV]<inf>D50%</inf>, GTV<inf>D0.1cc</inf>, GTV<inf>V90%</inf>, planning target volume [PTV]<inf>V70%</inf>) with a prescription dose of GTV<inf>D50%</inf> = 3 × 20 Gy and organ-at-risk (OAR) limits were distributed with computed tomography and structure sets from 3 patients with liver metastases. Thirty-five institutions provided 132 treatment plans using different irradiation techniques. These plans were first analyzed for target and OAR doses. Four different renormalization methods were performed (PTV<inf>Dmin</inf>, PTV<inf>D98%</inf>, PTV<inf>D2%</inf>, PTV<inf>Dmax</inf>). The resulting 660 treatments plans were evaluated regarding target doses to study the effect of dose renormalization to different prescription methods. A relative scoring system was used for comparisons. Results: GTV<inf>D50%</inf> prescription can be performed in all systems. Treatment plan harmonization was overall successful, with standard deviations for D<inf>max</inf>, PTV<inf>D98%</inf>, GTV<inf>D98%</inf>, and PTV<inf>Dmean</inf> of 1.6, 3.3, 1.9, and 1.5 Gy, respectively. Primary analysis showed 55 major deviations from clinical goals in 132 plans, whereas in only <20% of deviations GTV/PTV dose was traded for meeting OAR limits. GTV<inf>D50%</inf> prescription produced the smallest deviation from target planning objectives and between techniques, followed by the PTV<inf>Dmax</inf>, PTV<inf>D98%</inf>, PTV<inf>D2%</inf>, and PTV<inf>Dmin</inf> prescription. Deviations were significant for all combinations but for the PTV<inf>Dmax</inf> prescription compared with GTV<inf>D50%</inf> and PTV<inf>D98%</inf>. Based on the various dose prescription methods, all systems significantly differed from each other, whereas GTV<inf>D50%</inf> and PTV<inf>D98%</inf> prescription showed the least difference between the systems. Conclusions: This study showed the feasibility of harmonizing liver stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment plans across different treatment planning systems and delivery techniques when a sufficient set of clinical goals is given. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In manual guidance robotic applications, like the handling of large and heavy objects in a cluttered environment, it is important to guarantee that the operator accurately reaches the goal position without collisions with working isles or other obstacles in the surrounding environment. When the transported object is bulky, the operator's view is obstructed and the situation becomes more critical. In this work, a novel variable admittance control provides the operator with a directional haptic feedback about the best motion direction towards the goal. This feedback allows the user to accurately reach the target position in a cluttered environment, also in case his/her view is partially or totally obstructed. To select the best motion direction in a cluttered workspace, a tree-based structure rooted in the goal is optimally built offline to fully explore the environment free-space based on the workspace layout and regardless of the initial position. Then, at each time instant, the optimal motion direction is determined based on the current position with respect to the exploring structure and on the user motion intention. In this work, to build the tree structure, we adapt RRT∗ algorithm to the manual guidance context and we define a tailored cost function. The performance is evaluated in many scenarios with a variable number of obstacles of different shapes involving several subjects and a Comau Smart Six robot. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well-established modality for pre-operative planning and is also explored for intra-operative guidance of procedures such as intravascular interventions. Among the experimental robot-assisted technologies, the magnetic field gradients of the MRI scanner are used to power and maneuver ferromagnetic applicators for accessing sites in the patient's body via the vascular network. In this work, we propose a computational platform for preoperative planning and modeling of MRI-powered applicators inside blood vessels. This platform was implemented as a two-way data and command pipeline that links the MRI scanner, the computational core, and the operator. The platform first processes multi-slice MR data to extract the vascular bed and then fits a virtual corridor inside the vessel. This corridor serves as a virtual fixture (VF), a forbidden region for the applicators to avoid vessel perforation or collision. The geometric features of the vessel centerline, the VF, and MRI safety compliance (dB/dt, max available gradient) are then used to generate magnetic field gradient waveforms. Different blood flow profiles can be user-selected, and those parameters are used for modeling the applicator's maneuvering. The modeling module further generates cues about whether the selected vascular path can be safely maneuvered. Given future experimental studies that require a real-time operation, the platform was implemented on the Qt framework (C/C++) with software modules performing specific tasks running on dedicated threads: PID controller, generation of VF, generation of MR gradient waveforms. © 2022 ACM.},

A phenomenon is a representation of an entity "as the robot experiences it" through interaction. The SLAPI problem relates to the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem but differs in that it does not aim at constructing a precise map of the environment, and it can apply to robots with coarse sensors. We demonstrate a SLAPI algorithm to control a robot equipped with omni-directional wheels, an echo-localization sensor, photosensitive sensors, and an inertial measurement unit, but no precise sensors like camera, lidar, or odometry. As the robot circles around an object, it constructs the phenomenon corresponding to this object under the form of the set of the spatially-localized control loops of interaction that the object affords to the robot. SLAPI algorithms could help design companion robots that mimic intrinsic motivation such as curiosity and playfulness. Further studies of the SLAPI problem could improve the scientific understanding of how cognitive beings construct knowledge about objects from sensorimotor experience of interaction. © 2022 IWSSL.

In particular, a novel admittance control, that constrains the motion of the robot along a prescribed path without imposing a specific time law along it, has been devised. The proposed approach exploits the features of the arc-length parameterization of a generic curve to obtain a simple control formulation able to guide the patient in both a passive or an active way, with the possibility of supporting the execution of the task with an additional force or opposing the motion with a braking force. Being the method independent from the particular curve considered for the constraint specification, it allows an intuitive definition of the task to be performed via Programming by Demonstration.

	abstract = {In robot-assisted surgery, osteotomy is a common task with surgical tools such as reciprocating saws, the miller, and the ultrasound osteotome. Although, the mechanism of different surgical tools obtains different kinematics constraints. The restriction in the invasive direction is one of the most challenging issues in the osteotomy scenarios as it directly determines the performance for surgical safety. Shared control techniques based on Virtual Fixtures (VFs) can be an effective way to help the surgeon prevent overshoot during operation. This letter presents a region-based virtual fixture to restrict the robot's motion in the reference directions. In order to generate a task plane and divide the forbidden area, a PCA-algorithm-based method is proposed with the selected several points from the medical image-based software. A variable admittance policy based on the distance in the invasive direction is adopted to adjust the admittance scale for the hands-on robot system. As a result, the surgeon will obtain different robotic velocities in different areas. An accuracy analysis is applied to the error between the task plane and the manually selected points. The maximum projection error is 1.07 mm. The motion analysis in different areas is given, and the minimum distance in the invasive direction is 0.2229 mm to the border between the marginal area and the forbidden area. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Surgical robot is one of the most important application fields of human-robot collaboration. Since the operating objects are often fragile human tissues, how to improve the safety of the surgical process is the key for practical application of surgical robots. General human-robot interaction methods for safety such as collision detection and obstacle avoidance are relatively passive and robot-based, having difficulty in dealing with complex surgical scenarios. Virtual Fixture(VF), an active motion constraint method, is more suitable for shared control in surgical scenarios. This paper introduces a combination of VF method with admittance control for avoiding damage to robot or tissues while complying with doctor's intention. Firstly, in order to obtain the human-robot interaction force, a statistical method for six-dimensional force sensor calibration is proposed. Then, two velocity-based admittance control models are compared by simulation, and the first order inertial model is selected. On the basis of these, a variety of hard VFs with visual information are established. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method and the causes of violation are analyzed by experiments on a serial robot manipulator. © 2022 IEEE.},

By estimating haptic intention of human and adaptively restraining the operation force in unexpected direction, the adaptive shared control law is desired to continuously switch the lead priority to either the human or the robot. An adaptive admittance control strategy is thus developed based on the guidance virtual fixture (VF) /active constraint to promote the operation performance in collaborative tasks. By synthesizing adaptive admittance control and virtual fixture guidance, this comes true that the human operator's intention and predefined guidance trajectory are combined in shared control. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results validate that the proposed control strategy has potential to provide stability and flexibility in the specific tasks for the HRI system. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Proprioception and variable stiffness are two trending topics in soft robotics research. The former could endow soft robots with the ability to perceive the environment as well as their internal states without the need of dedicated sensors, while the latter could strengthen the otherwise excessive compliance, enabling soft robots for tasks which require a higher force. Both directions have been extensively reported in existing literature, achieving both concurrently was even more challenging. The major limiting factor was the limited stiffness due to the hyper elasticity of conventional soft robots, which increases the difficulties in capturing the continues deformation. In this work, we proposed an alternative approach to tackle these two challenges, a novel 'tune-down' approach, combining proprioception with stiffness regulation and implemented over-constrained soft robotic joint designs to further strengthen this spirit. As a result, the soft robotic joint could achieve multi-directional proprioception, as well as variable stiffness tuning, concurrently, using merely an on-board sensor for basic pneumatic control. The concept, design, modeling, actuation/control, and experimental validation were presented in detail, demonstrating the efficacy and potential of the proposed approach. © 2022 IEEE.},

The robotic system consists of an Omni-directional mobile base, a high-payload robotic arm, and an admittance-type interface acting as a support handle while measuring human-sourced interaction forces. The postural balance of the human body is estimated through the projection of the body Center of Mass (CoM) to the support polygon (SP) representing the quasi-static Center of Pressure (CoP). In response to the interaction forces and the tracking of the human posture, the robot can create assistive forces to restore balance in case of its loss. Otherwise, during normal stance or walking, it will follow the user with minimum/no opposing forces through the generation of coupled arm and base movements. As the balance-restoring strategy, we propose two strategies and evaluate them in a laboratory setting on healthy human participants. Quantitative and qualitative results of a 12-subjects experiment are then illustrated and discussed, comparing the performances of the two strategies and the overall system. © 2022 IEEE.},

Inspired by sandwich-structured composites with high structural strengths, widely employed in both nature and man-made structures, a mechanism of selectively stiffening garments (SSGs) utilizing anisotropic cellular cores and rubber-laminated face sheets is proposed. While the proposed mechanism shows a high compliance allowing for conformity to the wearer's body when unjammed, it provides a significantly high force density when jammed, compared to conventional jamming methods, allowing for the ability to adjust mechanical properties based on the designs and materials.

	abstract = {Flexible sensing tends to be widely exploited in the process of human–computer interactions of intelligent robots for its contact compliance and environmental adaptability. A novel flexible capacitive tactile sensor was proposed for multi-directional force sensing, which is based on carbon black/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite dielectric layer and upper and lower electrodes of carbon nanotubes/polydimethylsiloxane (CNTs/PDMS) composite layer. By changing the ratio of carbon black, the resolution of carbon black/PDMS composite layer increases at 4 wt%, and then decreases, which was explained according to the percolation theory of the conductive particles in the polymer matrix. Mathematical model of force and capacitance variance was established, which can be used to predict the value of the applied force. Then, the prototype with carbon black/PDMS composite dielectric layer was fabricated and characterized. SEM observation was conducted and a ratio was introduced in the composites material design. It was concluded that the resolution of carbon sensor can reach 0.1 N within 50 N in normal direction and 0.2 N in 0–10 N in tangential direction with good stability. Finally, the multi-directional force results were obtained. Compared with the individual directional force results, the output capacitance value of multi-directional force was lower, which indicated the amplitude decrease in capacity change in the normal and tangential direction. This might be caused by the deformation distribution in the normal and tangential direction under multi-directional force. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a wall-climbing robot featuring self-compliance for variable curvature façades. The high payload and maneuverability make it highly potential in heavy-duty operation of industrial applications. The robot consists of two traction modules and one link module. Each traction module is equipped with magnetic adhesion and crawler traction submodules. The two traction modules are connected by the link module with 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) of passive compliance. Variable curvature façade self-compliance is achieved by the passive compliant link module, which results in the attitude change decoupling of the two traction modules. The attitude can be adjusted under the effect of magnetic adhesion force to comply with the curvature variations. High payloads are achieved by the large contact area between the crawler and the surface. Omni-directional high maneuverability is enabled by the speed difference between the motors of two traction modules. The robot can maneuver in any direction on the surface with a minimum radius of 1 m and carry 36 kg payload on vertical surfaces. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, the potential for assistive devices to enhance the walking activity of the elderly has increased. Elderly have muscle weakness in their lower limbs and they are liable to persistent injuries because of falling on the ground. Lately, different mobility aid robots, especially canes, have been proposed to improve their walking activity. The complicated design and the unsuitability for real-time fall prevention are two main demerits of the proposed cane robots in literature. In this paper, it is proposed to develop a simple yet effective 4-DOF cane robot for real-time fall prevention of elderly to work in two modes namely, normal walking and fall prevention. It consists of a stick that is connected to an omni-directional mobile platform by a simple revolute joint. In the normal walking mode, the cane robot is kinematically controlled to follow the human in the front and achieve a desired distance and orientation apart from the human. The quite short response time that is required to prevent the elderly falling by the cane robot is a challenging problem. So, based on the full dynamic model in the 3D space, an impedance controller whose parameters tuned by the genetic algorithm with force/torque constraints is developed. Additionally, for the sake of using the proposed cane robot by different users with different heights and interactive forces, a model reference adaptive control is imposed to the cane robot to overcome the system uncertainties. The results prove that the four DOFs are enough to prevent falling and the kinematic controller achieves the follow-in-the-front concept accurately as well as the dynamic responses are suitable for real-time fall prevention and ensure the robustness against the uncertainties. © IMechE 2019.},

	abstract = {Understanding information processing in the brain—and creating general-purpose artificial intelligence—are long-standing aspirations of scientists and engineers worldwide. The distinctive features of human intelligence are high-level cognition and control in various interactions with the world including the self, which are not defined in advance and are vary over time. The challenge of building human-like intelligent machines, as well as progress in brain science and behavioural analyses, robotics, and their associated theoretical formalisations, speaks to the importance of the world-model learning and inference. In this article, after briefly surveying the history and challenges of internal model learning and probabilistic learning, we introduce the free energy principle, which provides a useful framework within which to consider neuronal computation and probabilistic world models. Next, we showcase examples of human behaviour and cognition explained under that principle. We then describe symbol emergence in the context of probabilistic modelling, as a topic at the frontiers of cognitive robotics. Lastly, we review recent progress in creating human-like intelligence by using novel probabilistic programming languages. The striking consensus that emerges from these studies is that probabilistic descriptions of learning and inference are powerful and effective ways to create human-like artificial intelligent machines and to understand intelligence in the context of how humans interact with their world. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Surface finishing, as the final stage in the manufacturing pipeline, is a key process in determining the quality and life span of a product. Such a task is characterized by low contact forces and minimal material removal from the object surface. Despite the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, human workforce is still irreplaceable in performing such tasks due to superior dexterity and adaptability, but this is often prone to risks such as hand-arm vibration syndrome due to hand-held tools. Therefore, we propose a collaborative approach to assist the human in carrying out such tasks with the help of two case studies: Human–Robot-Collaborative edge chamfering and polishing tasks, based on an impedance controlled collaborative curve tracing technique. We propose a collaborative framework, where the robot assists an operator to guide the end-effector/tool along a pre-defined parametric curve. The algorithm is demonstrated in two scenarios. In the first case, we address a collaborative chamfering task whereas the second case focuses on a polishing application (for straight edges). For these kinds of tasks, the curve to be traced assumes the shape of a straight line along the edge. We make use of the compliant feature of a cobot, which allows the user to physically guide the robot in the task space, to generate a mathematical model for the tool path. From the end-user perspective, this is more intuitive than the classical programming-based path planning approaches. In the process of machining, to enhance the path tracking accuracy and to ensure constant tool-surface contact, we implement guidance virtual fixtures through impedance control. As a result, the machining error is reduced. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {During communication, humans express their emotional states using various modalities (e.g., facial expressions and gestures), and they estimate the emotional states of others by paying attention to multimodal signals. To ensure that a communication robot with limited resources can pay attention to such multimodal signals, the main challenge involves selecting the most effective modalities among those expressed. In this study, we propose an active perception method that involves selecting the most informative modalities using a criterion based on energy minimization. This energy-based model can learn the probability of the network state using energy values, whereby a lower energy value represents a higher probability of the state. A multimodal deep belief network, which is an energy-based model, was employed to represent the relationships between the emotional states and multimodal sensory signals. Compared to other active perception methods, the proposed approach demonstrated improved accuracy using limited information in several contexts associated with affective human–robot interaction. We present the differences and advantages of our method compared to other methods through mathematical formulations using, for example, information gain as a criterion. Further, we evaluate performance of our method, as pertains to active inference, which is based on the free energy principle. Consequently, we establish that our method demonstrated superior performance in tasks associated with mutually correlated multimodal information. © © 2021 Horii and Nagai.},

	abstract = {In order to interact seamlessly with robots, users must infer the causes of a robot’s behavior–and be confident about that inference (and its predictions). Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, and despite its crucial role, it is still largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human relationship to technological systems. In the following paper we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, HRC, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that it is a trade-off between benevolence and competence; while studies of human to human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We go on to introduce a model of trust as an agent’ best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be casted in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. Interactive feedback is a necessary condition to the extension of the trustor’s perception-action cycle. This model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration–as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust, such as the benevolence and competence attributed to the trustee, to be defined in terms of hierarchical active inference, while vulnerability can be described in terms of information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model emphasizes the role of user feedback during HRC and suggests that boredom and surprise may be used in personalized interactions as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. The description of trust as a sense of virtual control offers a crucial step toward grounding human factors in cognitive neuroscience and improving the design of human-centered technology. Furthermore, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems. © Copyright © 2021 Schoeller, Miller, Salomon and Friston.},

While DEAs are mostly utilized to rely on carbon-based electrodes, there are certain shortcomings of the use of carbon electrodes in the field of soft robotics. In this work we present a fish-like bending structure to serve as possible propulsion element, completely avoiding carbon-based electrodes. The presented robot is moving under water, using a particularly tailored conductive hydrogel as inner electrode and a highly anisotropic textile material to manipulate the bending behavior of the robot. The charge separation to drive two DEAs on the outsides of the robot is provided by the conductive hydrogel while the surrounding water serves as counter electrode. To characterize the hydrogel, tensile tests and impedance spectroscopy are used as measurement methods of choice. The performance of the robot was evaluated using a digital image correlation (DIC) measurement for its bending deflections under water. The developed fish-like robot was able to perform a dynamic bending movement, based on a tri-stable actuator setup. The performed measurements underpin the sufficient characteristics for an underwater application of conductive hydrogel electrodes as well as the applicability of the robotic concept for under water actuations. © 2021 by the authors.

The controller accounts for the human body's inherent impedance properties and applies a range of robotic damping from negative (energy injection) to positive (energy dissipation) values based on the user's intent of motion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in balancing the trade-off between stability/agility and reducing user effort, two studies are performed on both the human upper-extremity and lower-extremity to represent both industrial and rehabilitation applications of the proposed controller. These studies required subjects to perform a series of multidimensional target reaching tasks while the human user interacted with either the end-effector of a robotic arm for the upper-extremity study or a wearable ankle robot for the lower-extremity study. Stability, agility, and user effort are quantified by a variety of performance metrics. Stability is quantified by both overshoot and stabilization time. Mean and maximum speed are used to quantify agility. To quantify the user effort, both overall and maximum muscle activation, and mean and maximum root-mean-squared interaction force are calculated. The results of both the upper- and lower-extremity studies demonstrate that the controller is able to reduce user effort while increasing agility at a negligible cost to stability. © 2013 IEEE.},

While translational movements are easily understandable for a human, rotational ones do not have an immediate interpretation. This does not allow the operator to achieve an adequate positioning accuracy when a target orientation is set. In this work, a suitable strategy that facilitates the human in accomplishing rotational motion is proposed through the formulation of rotational virtual fixtures. This is obtained thanks to a clever description of the orientation that allows to draw an equivalence between the formulation of translational virtual fixtures and their rotational counterparts. To further improve the human comprehension of the best motion direction in the rotational world, a variable admittance control is also designed. We finally propose to jointly exploit these techniques to achieve the best possible performance in terms of positioning accuracy. The performance are evaluated by means of rotational point to point cooperative motions involving several subjects and an ABB IRB-140 robot. © 2016 IEEE.},

This functionality is enabled by the high compliance of the robotic structure, which comprises very few parts, is easily fabricated, achieves both high precision and performance, and is sufficiently predictable to be controlled in open and closed loop. To demonstrate the locomotive and steering capabilities of the SMARTI, we present a series of experimental tests, including open-loop crawling, closed-loop path following, and high-speed controlled turning. These experiments were performed using amotion capture system for sensing and an off-board digital signal processor for control. In closed loop, the SMARTI reaches a maximum sustained speed of 46 mm/s, equivalent to 3.54 body-lengths per second (BL/s), and a turning rate of 107 degrees per second (D/s) with root-mean-square (RMS) tracking errors as low as 1.7mm.

	abstract = {Uneven terrain in natural environments challenges legged locomotion by inducing instability and causing limb collisions. During the swing phase, the limb releases from the ground and arcs forward to target a secure next foothold. In natural environments leg-obstacle collisions may occur during the swing phase which can result in instability, and may require contact sensing and trajectory re-planning if a collision occurs. However, collision detection and response often requires computationally- and temporally-expensive control strategies. Inspired by low stiffness limbs that can pass past obstacles in small insects and running birds, we investigated a passive method for overcoming swing-collisions. We implemented virtual compliance control in a robot leg that allowed us to systematically vary the limb stiffness and ultimately its response to collisions with obstacles in the environment. In addition to applying a standard positional control during swing motion, we developed two virtual compliance methods: (1) an isotropic compliance for which perturbations in the x and y directions generated the same stiffness response, and (2) a vertical anisotropic compliance in which a decrease of the upward y vertical limb stiffness enabled the leg to move upwards more freely. The virtual compliance methods slightly increased variability along the limb's planned pathway, but the anisotropic compliance control improved the successful negotiation of step obstacles by over 70% compared to isotropic compliance and positional control methods. We confirmed these findings in simulation and using a self-propelling bipedal robot walking along a linear rail over bumpy terrain. While the importance of limb compliance for stance interactions have been known, our results highlight how limb compliance in the swing-phase can enhance walking performance in naturalistic environments. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the presentation of a parallel compliance adaptation method for systems equipped with rotary motion mechanisms towards obtaining energy efficiency in cyclic tasks over a reasonable range of task frequency variations. In this work, we first introduce a variable parallel elastic actuator (VPEA) design for implementation on uni-directional joints that can respond in line with the torque requirements caused by frequency variations in rotary mechanisms. Then, in the next step, we propose two design approaches namely “general method” and “frequency-based method” for the VPEA along with the stiffness adjustment approaches both in offline and online manners. The optimality and convergence of the adaptation method for the proposed rotary VPEA are also analytically proved in general to be globally exponentially stable in the sense of Lyapunov. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our VPEA, we deployed it in a robotic leg model as the case study. The simulation results demonstrate the stability and convergence of our adaptation rule and highlight the performance of the proposed VPEA in increasing energy efficiency over a wide range of task frequency variations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Generalization by learning is an essential cognitive competency for humans. For example, we can manipulate even unfamiliar objects and can generate mental images before enacting a preplan. How is this possible? Our study investigated this problem by revisiting our previous study (Jung, Matsumoto, & Tani, 2019), which examined the problem of vision-based, goal-directed planning by robots performing a task of block stacking. By extending the previous study, our work introduces a large network comprising dynamically interacting submodules, including visual working memory (VWMs), a visual attention module, and an executive network. The executive network predicts motor signals, visual images, and various controls for attention, as well as masking of visual information. The most significant difference from the previous study is that our current model contains an additional VWM. The entire network is trained by using predictive coding and an optimal visuomotor plan to achieve a given goal state is inferred using active inference. Results indicate that our current model performs significantly better than that used in Jung et al. (2019), especially when manipulating blocks with unlearned colors and textures. Simulation results revealed that the observed generalization was achieved because content-agnostic information processing developed through synergistic interaction between the second VWM and other modules during the course of learning, in which memorizing image contents and transforming them are dissociated. This letter verifies this claim by conducting both qualitative and quantitative analysis of simulation results. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

However, the open issues of safety and efficiency have not been systematically addressed for pHRI. In this paper, a new intention-driven variable impedance controller is proposed for compliantly-driven robots, where the robot is controlled to track the estimated human motion intention under a variable desired impedance model. The human motion intention is represented with the desired angle of the human limb and approximated with adaptive neural networks (NNs). Then, the impedance parameters are adjusted online according to the offset between the desired angle and the current joint configuration of the robot. Such a formulation allows the robot to predict human behavior for better collaboration and hence improve the safety and the efficiency of pHRI. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved with Lyapunov methods, and experiments on a lower-limb exoskeleton are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller. © 2021 IEEE.},

In a set of simulation studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational recurrent neural network model. The model is based on the free energy principle such that a pair of interacting robots find themselves in a loop, attempting to predict and infer each other's actions using active inference. We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and interactions. When one robot trained with tighter regulation and another trained with looser regulation interact, the latter tends to lead the interaction by exerting stronger action intention, while the former tends to follow by adapting to its observations. The study confirms that the dyadic imitative interaction becomes successful by achieving a high synchronization rate when a leader and a follower are determined by developing action intentions with strong belief and weak belief, respectively. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Parallel manipulators have the potentials of high efficiency and high precision in the field of machining and manufacturing. However, accuracy improvement of the parallel manipulator is still an essential and challenging issue, encountering two important problems. Firstly, the ignorance of elastic deformation caused by gravity or deviations of static stiffness model restricts further improvement of accuracy. To solve this problem, an elasto-geometrical error modeling method is proposed. The comprehensive effects of structural errors, elastic deformation under gravity and compliance parameter errors on pose deviations are disclosed. On this basis, the identification equation of actual structural errors and compliance parameter errors can be established. Secondly, the ill-conditioned identification matrix and the identification equation with anisotropic residual error can lead to inaccurate identification results. To solve this problem, a weighted regularization method is proposed. The identification equation with isotropic residual error is built, and accurate identification can be realized with the regularization method. Based on the proposed methods, the error compensation experiment is conducted on the prototype of a five-axis parallel machining robot using a laser tracker. Experiment results show that the accuracy of the machining robot is significantly improved after compensation. An M1_160 test piece and an S-shaped test piece are machined and measured to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The elasto-geometrical error modeling method and the weighted regularization method can be applied to other parallel manipulators’ accuracy improvement. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Bioinspired hybrid soft robots that combine living and synthetic components are an emerging field in the development of advanced actuators and other robotic platforms (i.e., swimmers, crawlers, and walkers). The integration of biological components offers unique characteristics that artificial materials cannot precisely replicate, such as adaptability and response to external stimuli. Here, we present a skeletal muscle–based swimming biobot with a three-dimensional (3D)–printed serpentine spring skeleton that provides mechanical integrity and self-stimulation during the cell maturation process. The restoring force inherent to the spring system allows a dynamic skeleton compliance upon spontaneous muscle contraction, leading to a cyclic mechanical stimulation process that improves the muscle force output without external stimuli. Optimization of the 3D-printed skeletons is carried out by studying the geometrical stiffnesses of different designs via finite element analysis. Upon electrical actuation of the muscle tissue, two types of motion mechanisms are experimentally observed: directional swimming when the biobot is at the liquid-air interface and coasting motion when it is near the bottom surface. The integrated compliant skeleton provides both the mechanical self-stimulation and the required asymmetry for directional motion, displaying its maximum velocity at 5 hertz (800 micrometers per second, 3 body lengths per second). This skeletal muscle–based biohybrid swimmer attains speeds comparable with those of cardiac-based biohybrid robots and outperforms other muscle-based swimmers. The integration of serpentine-like structures in hybrid robotic systems allows self-stimulation processes that could lead to higher force outputs in current and future biomimetic robotic platforms. © © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved;},

The controller applies a range of robotic damping from negative to positive values to either inject or dissipate energy based on the user's intent of motion. The controller also estimates the user's intent of direction and applies a variable stiffness torque to stabilize the user towards an estimated ideal trajectory. To evaluate the controller's ability to improve the stability/agility trade-off and reduce human effort, a study was designed for human subjects to perform a 2D target reaching task while coupled with a wearable ankle robot. A constant impedance condition was selected as a control with which to compare the variable impedance condition. The position, speed, and muscle activation responses were used to quantify the user's stability, agility, and effort, respectively. Stability was quantified spatially and temporally, with both overshoot and stabilization time showing no statistically significant difference between the two experimental conditions. Agility was quantified using mean and maximum speed, with both increasing from the constant impedance to variable impedance condition by 29.8% and 59.9%, respectively. Effort was quantified by the overall and maximum muscle activation data, both of which showed a ∼10% reduction in effort.

The present study deals with a piecewise collaborative drilling task assisted by a robot while containing aligning and drilling. It can enable surgeons to complete the operation more efficiently and accurately. The switched virtual fixture (VF) between drilling and aligning can be addressed using intention recognition, which learns from demonstrating human-guided force during the collaborative drilling. The training of the switching condition is derived in terms of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and the intention recognition is achieved using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the GMMs and human-guided real-time sampled forces. To evaluate the performance of aligning and drilling, two experiments are conducted corresponding to the steps of drilling tasks. The compliance, accuracy, and costing time are demonstrated in the experiments.

	abstract = {We present a design method for the admittance control of a class of omnidirectional mobile platforms. Holonomic behavior of the platform is accomplished by a steering system that is itself subject to nonholonomic constraints. The proposed application of this type of platform, henceforth the “walker”, is as an assistive device for human gait rehabilitation. Therefore, the control design objectives are to guarantee the stability of the coupled system formed by the robotic platform and the human body, and to maximize mobility for the user by reducing the robot’s apparent inertia. First, we show how feedback linearization of a reduced-order model of the system, combined with a smooth trajectory-tracking control, achieves global asymptotic stability of the tracking error. Then we show how compliance in the robot limits the amount of inertia reduction that can be achieved before instability occurs. We address this problem with a control design method that maximizes the amplitude of the system’s admittance over a useful range of frequencies. Using root locus analysis and sensitivity transfer functions, we find an optimal value for the virtual mass in the admittance model, representing the best tradeoff between two oscillatory modes. The walker’s admittance vs. frequency function is then corrected via a complementary sensor input, namely, the user’s torque on the sagittal plane. A second layer of control provides the walker’s therapeutic action, consisting of a variable horizontal force that aids propulsion of the user’s body. The level of assistive force is modulated with the patient’s gait speed and turning rate to ensure easy adaptation. The control design was validated through an experiment involving human users walking in a prototype of the mobile platform. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Despite the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, there are many tooling tasks with cognitive aspects that are rather challenging for robots to handle in full autonomy, thus still requiring a certain degree of interaction with a human operator. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for both planning and execution of robot-surface contact tasks whereby interaction with a human operator can be accommodated to a variable degree. The starting point is the geometry of surface, which we assume known and available in a discretized format, e.g. through scanning technologies. To allow for realtime computation, rather than interacting with thousands of vertices, the robot only interacts with a single proxy, i.e. a massless virtual object constrained to ‘live on’ the surface and subject to first order viscous dynamics. The proxy and an impedance-controlled robot are then connected through tuneable and possibly viscoelastic coupling, i.e. (virtual) springs and dampers. On the one hand, the proxy slides along discrete geodesics of the surface in response to both viscoelastic coupling with the robot and to a possible external force (a virtual force which can be used to induce autonomous behaviours). On the other hand, the robot is free to move in 3D in reaction to the same viscoelastic coupling as well as to a possible external force, which includes an actual force exerted by a human operator. The proposed approach is multi-objective in the sense that different operational (autonomous/collaborative) and interactive (for contact/non-contact tasks) modalities can be realized by simply modulating the viscoelastic coupling as well as virtual and physical external forces. We believe that our proposed framework might lead to a more intuitive interfacing to robot programming, as opposed to standard coding. To this end, we also present numerical and experimental studies demonstrating path planning as well as autonomous and collaborative interaction for contact tasks with a free-form surface. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This work tackles the issue of estimating the most likely final target towards which the operator is guiding the end-effector of the manipulator to actively assist him/her in accomplishing the task. A novel inference algorithm, based on Bayesian statistics, has been developed. It predicts the most likely 3D target among a predefined set and it also takes into account the possibility that the human drives the robot towards an unknown target. Then, a variable admittance control has also been conceived. It suitably adapts its parameters to establish a directional haptic feedback that helps the human accurately reach the desired goal position. The proposed strategies allow the human to precisely reach the goal even when his/her view is obstructed by the transported object. These algorithms have been validated through point to point collaborative motions with several volunteers and an ABB IRB140 robot. © 2021 IEEE.},

Secondly, we proposed variable admittance control models governed by human intentions. Power envelope approaches were then proposed to impose constraints on the variable admittance parameters inferred from human intention for maintaining passivity conservatively. Our passivity preserving approaches were validated via simulation and shown to avoid mismatching of time-varying admittance parameters that restrain drastic changes of admittance controller dynamics, which usually result in instability. Finally, the relationship between the robot's passivity and stability when it interacts with the human was analyzed. © 2021 IEEE.},

Specifically, we consider a planar parallel link mechanism with nine degrees-of-freedom (DoF) consisting of six active revolute pairs with rotary actuators, eighteen passive revolute pairs, and nineteen links. Six of the passive revolute pairs are elastically constrained by torsional coil springs, thus the mechanism has passive compliance.

	abstract = {Interdisciplinary efforts from developmental psychology, phenomenology, and philosophy of mind, have studied the rudiments of social cognition and conceptualized distinct forms of intersubjective communication and interaction at human early life. Interaction theorists consider primary intersubjectivity a non-mentalist, pre-theoretical, non-conceptual sort of processes that ground a certain level of communication and understanding, and provide support to higher-level cognitive skills. We argue the study of human/neurorobot interaction consists in a unique opportunity to deepen understanding of underlying mechanisms in social cognition through synthetic modeling, while allowing to examine a second person experiential (2PP) access to intersubjectivity in embodied dyadic interaction. Concretely, we propose the study of primary intersubjectivity as a 2PP experience characterized by predictive engagement, where perception, cognition, and action are accounted for an hermeneutic circle in dyadic interaction. From our interpretation of the concept of active inference in free-energy principle theory, we propose an open-source methodology named neural robotics library (NRL) for experimental human/neurorobot interaction, wherein a demonstration program named virtual Cartesian robot (VCBot) provides an opportunity to experience the aforementioned embodied interaction to general audiences. Lastly, through a study case, we discuss some ways human-robot primary intersubjectivity can contribute to cognitive science research, such as to the fields of developmental psychology, educational technology, and cognitive rehabilitation. © Copyright © 2020 Chame, Ahmadi and Tani.},

	abstract = {Continuum robots exhibit promising adaptability and dexterity for soft manipulation due to their intrinsic compliance. However, this compliance may lead to challenges in modeling as well as positioning and loading. In this paper, a virtual work-based static model is established to describe the deformation and mechanics of continuum robots with a generic rod-driven structure, taking the geometric constraint of the drive rods into account. Following this, this paper presents a novel variable stiffness mechanism powered by a set of embedded Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) springs, which can make the drive rods become ‘locked’ on the body structure with different configurations. The resulting effects of variable stiffness are then presented in the static model by introducing tensions of the SMA and friction on the rods. Compared with conventional models, there is no need to predefine the actuation forces of the drive rods; instead, actuation displacements are used in this new mechanism system with stiffness being regulated. As a result, the phenomenon that the continuum robot can exhibit an S-shaped curve when subject to single-directional forces is observed and analyzed. Simulations and experiments demonstrated that the presented mechanism has stiffness variation of over 287% and further demonstrated that the mechanism and its model are achievable with good accuracy, such that the ratio of positioning error is less than 2.23% at the robot end-effector to the robot length. © The Author(s) 2020.},

Because the higher computation time likely to render the lower accuracy. To this particular purpose, a cosine dependent sound source localization (SSL) with varying azimuth angles (0°-360°) is presented using a bio-inspired MEMS directional micro-phone. The developed microphone was measured in an anechoic chamber. The directivity was found in a full compliance with the cosine dependent ideal pressure-gradient sensor. With the satisfactory directionality, the SSL was formulated by considering one diaphragm of the developed directional microphone, and the maximum SSL deviation relative to the incoming sound was found to be 3.8° which is better than the TDOA based SSL algorithms.

	abstract = {Variable admittance control is commonly used for a collaborative robot to achieve the compliant or accurate cooperation according to human’s intention. However, existing research seldom investigates such a human-robot collaboration coupled with an extra environment with unknown stiffness. If the end-effector that is guided by a human with various intended motion contacts the unknown environment, the interaction might become unstable. Additionally, current research for this physical human-robot-environment interaction use two force sensors to address the issue, and hence the cost of the robot is likely to increase and it reduces the flexibility to many applications. Therefore, in this paper, we address the issue of physical human-robot interaction coupled with an extra environment whose stiffness is unknown. To achieve this, the condition of robot admittance is rigorously proved in accordance with different human intended motion and environmental stiffness. Moreover, a variable admittance control scheme is proposed based on human intention, environmental force and environment stiffness using the combination of a force sensor and a force observer. Simulation and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

The tracking error in combination with the interaction forces and torques is used by a variable stiffness strategy to adjust the progressive automation level and transition the leading role between the human and the robot.

	abstract = {When agents interact socially with different intentions (or wills), conflicts are difficult to avoid. Although the means by which social agents can resolve such problems autonomously has not been determined, dynamic characteristics of agency may shed light on underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the current study focused on the sense of agency, a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's intention in acting and the outcome, especially in social interaction contexts. Employing predictive coding and active inference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's sense of agency and should have a significant impact on social interactions. To evaluate this hypothesis, we built a computational model of imitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body movement data, which serve as the counterpart in the interactions. A key feature of the model is that the complexity of each modality can be regulated differently by changing the values of a hyperparameter assigned to each local module of the model. We first searched for an optimal setting of hyperparameters that endow the model with appropriate coordination of multimodal sensation. These searches revealed that complexity of the vision module should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception module because of greater uncertainty in visual information flow. Using this optimally trained model as a default model, we investigated how changing the tightness of complexity regulation in the entire network after training affects the strength of the sense of agency during imitative interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation of complexity, an agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other. In contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by adjusting its intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity regulation significantly affects the strength of the sense of agency and the dynamics of interactions between agents in social settings. © Copyright © 2020 Ohata and Tani.},

The information gathered from these evaluations describes the performances of robots from different points of view.

However, only a selected group of animals, mainly high order mammals such as humans, has passed the mirror test, a behavioural experiment proposed to assess self-recognition abilities. In this paper, we describe self-recognition as a process that is built on top of body perception unconscious mechanisms. We present an algorithm that enables a robot to perform non-appearance self-recognition on a mirror and distinguish its simple actions from other entities, by answering the following question: Am I generating these sensations The algorithm combines active inference, a theoretical model of perception and action in the brain, with neural network learning. The robot learns the relation between its actions and its body with the effect produced in the visual field and its body sensors. The prediction error generated between the models and the real observations during the interaction is used to infer the body configuration through free energy minimization and to accumulate evidence for recognizing its body. Experimental results on a humanoid robot show the reliability of the algorithm for different initial conditions, such as mirror recognition in any perspective, robot-robot distinction and human-robot differentiation. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.},

	abstract = {Snake robots have the potential to maneuver through tightly packed and complex environments. One challenge in enabling them to do so is the complexity in determining how to coordinate their many degrees-of-freedom to create purposeful motion. This is especially true in the types of terrains considered in this work: environments full of unmodeled features that even the best of maps would not capture, motivating us to develop closed-loop controls to react to those features. To accomplish this, this work uses proprioceptive sensing, mainly the force information measured by the snake robot's joints, to react to unmodeled terrain. We introduce a biologically-inspired strategy called directional compliance which modulates the effective stiffness of the robot so that it conforms to the terrain in some directions and resists in others. We present a dynamical system that switches between modes of locomotion to handle situations in which the robot gets wedged or stuck. This approach enables the snake robot to reliably traverse a planar peg array and an outdoor three-dimensional pile of rocks. © 2020 AACC.},

More flexibility and compliance attributing to soft functional materials used in the fabrication of these devices make them ideal for delivering delicate tasks in fragile environments, such as food and biomedical sectors. Yet, the intuitive nonlinearity of soft functional materials and their anisotropic actuation in compliant mechanisms constitute an existent challenge in improving their performance. Topology optimization (TO) along with four-dimensional (4D) printing is a powerful digital tool that can be used to obtain optimal internal architectures for the efficient performance of porous soft actuators. This paper employs TO analysis for achieving high bending deflection of a 3D printed polyelectrolyte actuator, which shows bending deformations in response to electrical stimuli in an electrolyte solution. The performance of the actuator is studied in terms of maximum bending and actuation rate compared with a solid, uniformly 3D printed and topology-optimized actuator. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of TO on achieving higher bending deformation and actuation rate against a uniformly 3D printed actuator. © 2019, The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.},

The two facesheets serve as both piezoresistive sensors and electrodes for the capacitive sensor, with the core being a porous structure made by using a simple sugar particle template technique to give them high stretchability. The two facesheets contain segregated conductive networks of silver nanowires (AgNWs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs). By measuring the changes in the electrical resistance of the facesheets and the capacitance between the facesheets, three separate mechanical stimuli can be determined, including normal pressure, in-plane stretch, and transverse shear force.

	abstract = {Collaborative robots should ideally use low torque actuators for passive safety reasons. However, some applications require these collaborative robots to reach deep into confined spaces while assisting a human operator in physically demanding tasks. In this paper, we consider the use of in-situ collaborative robots (ISCRs) that balance the conflicting demands of passive safety dictating low torque actuation and the need to reach into deep confined spaces. We consider the judicious use of bracing as a possible solution to these conflicting demands and present a modeling framework that takes into account the constrained kinematics and the effect of bracing on the endeffector compliance. We then define a redundancy resolution framework that minimizes the directional compliance of the end-effector while maximizing end-effector dexterity. Kinematic simulation results show that the redundancy resolution strategy successfully decreases compliance and improves kinematic conditioning while satisfying the constraints imposed by the bracing task. Applications of this modeling framework can support future research on the choice of bracing locations and support the formation of an admittance control framework for collaborative control of ISCRs under bracing constraints. Such robots can benefit workers in the future by reducing the physiological burdens that contribute to musculoskeletal injury. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Although their locomotion on flat surfaces using planar gaits is inherently stable, when snakes deform their body out of plane to traverse complex terrain, maintaining stability becomes a challenge. On trees and desert dunes, snakes grip branches or brace against depressed sand for stability. However, how they stably surmount obstacles like boulders too large and smooth to gain such 'anchor points' is less understood. Similarly, snake robots are challenged to stably traverse large, smooth obstacles for search and rescue and building inspection. Our recent study discovered that snakes combine body lateral undulation and cantilevering to stably traverse large steps. Here, we developed a snake robot with this gait and snake-like anisotropic friction and used it as a physical model to understand stability principles. The robot traversed steps as high as a third of its body length rapidly and stably. However, on higher steps, it was more likely to fail due to more frequent rolling and flipping over, which was absent in the snake with a compliant body. Adding body compliance reduced the robot's roll instability by statistically improving surface contact, without reducing speed. Besides advancing understanding of snake locomotion, our robot achieved high traversal speed surpassing most previous snake robots and approaching snakes, while maintaining high traversal probability. © 2020 The Authors.

They accomplish this feat by means of elastic compliance of connective tissue, which passively redistributes the overlapping flight feathers when the skeleton moves to morph the wing planform. Distinctive microstructures form “directional Velcro,” such that when adjacent feathers slide apart during extension, thousands of lobate cilia on the underlapping feathers lock probabilistically with hooked rami of overlapping feathers to prevent gaps. These structures unlock automatically during flexion. Using a feathered biohybrid aerial robot, we demonstrate how both passive mechanisms make morphing wings robust to turbulence. We found that the hooked microstructures fasten feathers across bird species except silent fliers, whose feathers also lack the associated Velcro-like noise.

This paper aims to promote mutual adaptation in negotiation when both parties possess incomplete information. Design/methodology/approach: This paper introduces virtual fixtures into the traditional negotiation mechanism, locally regulating tracking trajectory and impedance parameters in the negotiating phase until the final plan integrates bilateral intentions well. In the strategy, robots convey its task information to humans and offer groups of guide plans for them to choose, on the premise of maximizing the robot’s own profits. Findings: Compared with traditional negotiation strategies, humans adapt to robots easily and show lower cognitive load in the method, while the satisfied plan shows better performance for the whole human-robot system. Originality/value: In this study, this paper proposes a novel negotiation strategy to facilitate the mutual adaptation of humans and robots in complicated shared tasks, especially when both parties possess incomplete information of tasks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {An investigation on antenna solutions for expendable origami paper flapping robots is presented. An origami flapping robotic bird that can be produced using standard A4 paper is employed. Antennas resonating at the two commonly used frequency bands, 2.4 GHz and 5.2 GHz, are designed for the limited space available on the folded origami structure. Two developments of the same dual-band monopole antenna are discussed. The first antenna is located on the robot's spine and the second on its tail. A space diversity configuration is also studied. The antennas are printed directly onto a photo paper substrate and then folded into an origami robotic crane's body structure. An ordinary desktop inkjet printer fitted with silver nanoparticle conductive ink cartridges has been employed. CST Microwave StudioTM has been used to design the antennas. A good agreement between the measured and simulated S11 results is achieved with a reasonable-10dB impedance bandwidth realized in the three cases studied. The radiation patterns are omnidirectional in the XZ plane which is desirable for the specific application. The diversity configuration has a mutual coupling of 23dB and a gain of 1.4 dB and 2.8 dB at 2.4 GHz and 5.2 GHz respectively. The aim is to provide a new vision for antennas embedded into expandable flying robots based on traditional origami structures. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

In an attempt to off-load some of the physically-demanding tasks and automate mundane duties of overburdened nurses, we have developed the Adaptive Robotic Nursing Assistant (ARNA), which is a custom-built omnidirectional mobile platform with a 6-DoF robotic manipulator and a force sensitive walking handlebar. In this paper, we present a robot-specific neuroadaptive controller (NAC) for ARNA’s mobile base that employs online learning to estimate the robot’s unknown dynamic model and nonlinearities. This control scheme relies on an inner-loop torque controller and features convergence with Lyapunov stability guarantees. The NAC forces the robot to emulate a mechanical system with prescribed admittance characteristics during patient walking exercises and bed moving tasks. The proposed admittance controller is implemented on a model of the robot in a Gazebo-ROS simulation environment, and its effectiveness is investigated in terms of online learning of robot dynamics as well as sensitivity to payload variations. © © 2020 ASME},

Based on finite-state machine (FSM), a hierarchical controller was designed to ensure the control system performance while different control strategies were implemented on each individual gait phase. Three independent force sensing resistor (FSR) mounted under sole, two pressure transducers and a displacement sensor used as ankle rotation sensor provide feedback signal for both state detection and low-level impedance control.

These joints are machined into a tube made of a super-elastic material to create two joints near the tip of the tool. The directional stiffness properties of the flexural joint are exploited to minimize inter-joint coupling. We perform a static analysis of each joint and a kinematic analysis of the entire robot. We follow this with the design of a hand-held controller for this robot, and analyze its ability to control multiple degrees-of-freedom of the robot while minimizing the coupling between joints. © 2019 IEEE.},

MOCA is a new research platform developed at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), which is composed of a lightweight manipulator arm, a Pisa/IIT SoftHand, and a mobile platform driven by four omni-directional wheels. A whole-body impedance controller is consequently developed to ensure accurate tracking of the impedance and position trajectories at MOCA end-effector by considering the causal interactions in such a dynamic system. The proposed teleoperation interface provides the user with two control modes: locomotion and manipulation. The locomotion mode receives inputs from a personalized human center-of-pressure model, which enables real-time navigation of the MOCA mobile base in the environment. The manipulation mode receives inputs from a tele-impedance interface, which tracks human arm endpoint stiffness and trajectory profiles in real time and replicates them using the MOCA's whole-body impedance controller. To evaluate the performance of the proposed teleoperation interface in the execution of remote tasks with dynamic uncertainties, a sequence of challenging actions, i.e., navigation, door opening, and wall drilling, has been considered in the experimental setup. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Emerging trends in neurosciences are providing converging evidence that cortical networks in predominantly motor areas are activated in several contexts related to ‘action’ that do not cause any overt movement. Indeed for any complex body, human or embodied robot inhabiting unstructured environments, the dual processes of shaping motor output during action execution and providing the self with information related to feasibility, consequence and understanding of potential actions (of oneself/others) must seamlessly alternate during goal-oriented behaviors, social interactions. While prominent approaches like Optimal Control, Active Inference converge on the role of forward models, they diverge on the underlying computational basis. In this context, revisiting older ideas from motor control like the Equilibrium Point Hypothesis and synergy formation, this article offers an alternative perspective emphasizing the functional role of a ‘plastic, configurable’ internal representation of the body (body-schema) as a critical link enabling the seamless continuum between motor control and imagery. With the central proposition that both “real and imagined” actions are consequences of an internal simulation process achieved though passive goal-oriented animation of the body schema, the computational/neural basis of muscleless motor synergies (and ensuing simulated actions without movements) is explored. The rationale behind this perspective is articulated in the context of several interdisciplinary studies in motor neurosciences (for example, intracranial depth recordings from the parietal cortex, FMRI studies highlighting a shared cortical basis for action ‘execution, imagination and understanding’), animal cognition (in particular, tool-use and neuro-rehabilitation experiments, revealing how coordinated tools are incorporated as an extension to the body schema) and pertinent challenges towards building cognitive robots that can seamlessly “act, interact, anticipate and understand” in unstructured natural living spaces. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The presence of artificial agents in human social networks is growing. From chatbots to robots, human experience in the developed world is moving towards a socio-technical system in which agents can be technological or biological, with increasingly blurred distinctions between. Given that emotion is a key element of human interaction, enabling artificial agents with the ability to reason about affect is a key stepping stone towards a future in which technological agents and humans can work together. This paper presents work on building intelligent computational agents that integrate both emotion and cognition. These agents are grounded in the well-established social-psychological Bayesian Affect Control Theory (BayesAct). The core idea of BayesAct is that humans are motivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: they strive for their social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their sense of identity and general world views as constructed through culturally shared symbols. This affective alignment creates cohesive bonds between group members, and is instrumental for collaborations to solidify as relational group commitments. BayesAct agents are motivated in their social interactions by a combination of affective alignment and decision theoretic reasoning, trading the two off as a function of the uncertainty or unpredictability of the situation. This paper provides a high-level view of dual process theories and advances BayesAct as a plausible, computationally tractable model based in social-psychological and sociological theory. © 2019 IEEE.},

A multi-user shared control architecture is developed, and a multilateral impedance-controlled strategy is employed for this architecture. The desired objectives of the proposed system are (a) providing position guidance to the trainees during training procedure, (b) providing force feedback to all human operators (trainer and trainees) regardless of their levels of authority over the slave robot, (c) motion compensation for the heart’s motion, and (d) reflecting only the non-oscillatory force portion of the slave-heart tissue interaction force to all human operators. To this end, virtual fixtures and a dominance factor are introduced, and a reference impedance model with adjusted parameters is designed for each master or slave robot. The proposed impedance-based control methodology is evaluated experimentally. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could be used for surgical training and cooperation in beating-heart surgery by providing appropriate position guidance and environmental force feedback to the human operators. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents and verifies a novel Cartesian impedance control of the flexible joint manipulator for physical human–robot interaction application based on virtual decomposition control approach. Firstly, the Cartesian impedance control based on virtual decomposition control (VDC) is presented, and the asymptotical stability of the controller is proven by Lyapunov stability theorem. Compared with traditional methods based on singular perturbation, this method can greatly reduce the computational loads and is more suitable for real-time application. Then, a Cartesian force-feedback path planning combined with Cartesian impedance control based on VDC was used to keep the real contact force within the desired value to protect the manipulator and objects as a force, position, velocity and acceleration sensor, and the sensor can be configured freely by regulating the stiffness, damping and inertia, so the manipulator can interact with human (or unknown environment) in a friendly manner. The experimental results illustrate the validity of the developed VDC-based impedance control approach. © 2018, Shiraz University.},

In this letter, we investigate the design of soft digging robots inspired by the bristled worm, (polychaetas). The behavior of soft structures in dry granular environments is complex and still not well understood. We describe the design and fabrication of a soft robot capable of locomotion in granular substrates and investigate actuation strategies for drag reduction inspired by the bristled worms biomechanical behaviors. The drag reduction experiments focus on an actuated soft leading segment. We implemented and studied two methods of actuation for the leading segment: periodic radial expansion and bi-directional bending, both of which we find to have an impact on the locomotion in granular substrates. Soft robots performing periodic radial expansion of the leading segments experienced the least overall drag force, while those with unactuated tips experienced the largest drag force, emphasizing the importance of controlling the tip stiffness to enable effective subsurface movement. Based on these results, we designed and tested a tethered, three-segment soft robot capable of digging through dry granular media. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In adult laparoscopy, robot-aided surgery is a reality in thousands of operating rooms worldwide, owing to the increased dexterity provided by the robotic tools. Many robots and robot control techniques have been developed to aid in more challenging scenarios, such as pediatric surgery and microsurgery. However, the prevalence of case-specific solutions, particularly those focused on non-redundant robots, reduces the reproducibility of the initial results in more challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose a general framework for the control of surgical robotics in constrained workspaces under teleoperation, regardless of the robot geometry. Our technique is divided into a slave-side constrained optimization algorithm, which provides virtual fixtures, and with Cartesian impedance on the master side to provide force feedback. Experiments with two robotic systems, one redundant and one non-redundant, show that smooth teleoperation can be achieved in adult laparoscopy and infant surgery. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In endoscopic sinus surgery, the robot assists the surgeon in holding the endoscope and acts as the surgeon's third hand, which helps to reduce the surgeon's operating burden and improve the quality of the operation. This paper proposes a human-robot cooperative control method based on virtual fixture to realize accurate and safe human-robot interaction in endoscopic sinus surgery. Firstly, through endoscopic trajectory analysis, the endoscopic motion constraint requirements of different surgical stages are obtained, and three typical virtual fixtures suitable for endoscopic sinus surgery are designed and implemented. Based on the typical virtual fixtures, a composite virtual fixture is constructed, and then the overall robot motion constraint model is obtained. Secondly, based on the obtained robot motion constraint model, a human-robot cooperative control method based on virtual fixture is proposed. The method adopts admittance control to realize efficient human-robot interaction between the surgeon and robot during the surgery; the virtual fixture is used to restrain and guide the motion of the robot, thereby ensuring motion safety of the robot. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated through a robot-assisted nasal endoscopy experiment, and the result shows that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and safety of operation during endoscopic sinus surgery. © 2019 by the authors.},

Thus, most model-based control techniques developed for soft robots and soft haptic interfaces are specific to the particular device. In this letter, we develop a general method for stiffness control of soft robots suitable for arbitrary robot geometry and many types of actuation. Extending previous work that uses finite element modeling for position control, we determine the relationship between end-effector and actuator compliance, including the inherent device compliance, and use this to determine the appropriate controlled actuator stiffness for a desired stiffness of the end-effector. Such stiffness control, as the first component of impedance control, can be used to compensate for the natural stiffness of the deformable device and to control the robot's interaction with the environment or a user. We validate the stiffness projection on a deformable robot and include this stiffness projection in a haptic control loop to render a virtual fixture. © 2016 IEEE.},

For remotely controlling a mobile robot, steering and acceleration commands can be generated by a 3-DOF joystick using x, y, and z directional motions, respectively. Usually, a remote operator cannot clearly watch dynamically changing terrain conditions; therefore, it is necessary to feedback the slope and tilt conditions of the road to the operator through the joystick. These values can be obtained based on the inertial navigation system (INS) and feedback to the joystick as kind of reflection forces. Further, a yaw angle has been used to feedback the actual direction of the robot through a steering control. The mechanism and control systems of the hybrid joystick are newly designed, and the effectiveness of this hybrid joystick has been verified through actual remote operation of a mobile robot driving on slanted and tilted terrain. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We show that if the partner guides the robot with the gaze cue, the robot recognizes the intended action primitive even in the case of ambiguous actions.

	abstract = {Physical human-robot interaction(pHRI) is the most popular way to ensure the safety in robot surgery. Current research of pHRI in operation room focuses on the inside of the surgical area, which adapts virtual fixtures method for ensuring the safety of drag. But the safety problems caused by human error in the stage of dragging the robot from the outside surgical area to the inside surgical area are ignored. Therefore, a method of applying virtual fixtures to the outside of the surgical area is proposed to solve the safety issues during dragging stage outside surgical area. This method takes the kinematics model of human arm as the reference motion trajectory to construct the guided virtual fixtures, which is to restrict the robot movement in a defined area during the pHRI drag. This drag is based on admittance control method to improve safety and ensure flexibility. Experiment results show that the constructed guided virtual fixtures with the trajectory of the human arm model as the central axis, with radius 30mm, and restrict area 5mm can effectively limit the robot motion to a certain range. Simultaneously, the output speed of the robot in tangent direction of the central axis can well follow the change of the force applied by the doctor, and the output speed in the normal direction of the central axis can converge to zero stably at the pipeline boundary. Consequently, the purpose of improving the safety and flexibility of the surgical robot before surgical operation is realized. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robots have been increasingly used in production line and real life, such as warehousing, logistics, security, smart home and so on. In most applications, localization is always one of the most basic tasks of the robot. To acquire the object location, existing work mainly relies on computer vision. Such methods encounter many problems in practice, such as high computational complexity, large influence by light conditions, and heavy crafting of pre-training. These problems have become one of the key factors that constrains the precise automation of robots. This paper proposes an RFID-based robot navigation and target localization scheme, which is easy to deploy, low cost, and can work in non-line-of-sight scenarios. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. We collect the phase variation of the tag by a rotating reader antenna, and calculate the azimuth of the tag relative to the antenna by the channel similarity weighted average method. Then, the location of the tag is determined by the AoA method. 2. Based on the theory of tag equivalent circuit, antenna radiation field, and cylindrical symmetry oscillator mutual impedance, the phenomenon of RSS weakening of adjacent tags is analyzed. Based on this phenomenon, we achieve accurate target localization and multi-target relative localization by utilizing region segmentation and dynamic time warping algorithms. 3. The proposed scheme is lightweight and low-cost. We built a prototype system using commercial UHF RFID readers and passive tags, and conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that the model can effectively achieve the precise location of the robot and the object with an average error of 27 cm and 2 cm. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.},

It was shown previously that RNNs can be used to effectively infer goal-directed action control policies online. This is achieved by projecting hypothetical environmental interactions dependent on anticipated motor neural activities into the future, back-projecting the discrepancies between predicted and desired future states onto the motor neural activities. Here, we integrate distance signals surrounding a simulated robot flying in a 2D space into this active motor inference process. As a result, local obstacle avoidance emerges in a natural manner. We demonstrate in several experiments with static as well as dynamic obstacle constellations that a simulated flying robot controlled by our RNN-based procedure automatically avoids collisions, while pursuing goal-directed behavior. Moreover, we show that the flight direction dependent regulation of the sensory sensitivity facilitates fast and smooth traversals through tight maze-like environments. In conclusion, it appears that local and global objectives can be integrated seamlessly into RNN-based, model-predictive active inference processes, as long as the objectives do not yield competing gradients. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The monitoring companion consists of an industrial manipulator (monitoring robot) and a Unity-ROS framework for controlling it. We discuss in this paper the features that allow the solution to be re-used in different industrial application thanks to its compatibility with ROS. In particular, we present the approach based on admittance virtual fixtures and how we use such abstraction to track a moving target (it could be the end-effector of another robot for example). Moreover, the concept of varying compliance is introduced as a way to influence the motion of the monitoring robot on the virtual fixtures in the presence of obstacles. The experiments have been conducted in simulation as well as on real hardware to test the accuracy of the system at respecting the virtual fixtures with both a static and a moving monitoring target, although in the current implementation the varying compliance was not included in the experiments. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research explores a new realm of soft robotic materials where the stiffness magnitude, directionality, and spatial resolution may be precisely controlled. These materials mimic biological systems where localized muscle contractions and adjustment of tissue stiffness enables meticulous, intelligent movement. Here we propose the use of a low-melting-point (LMP) metal lattice structure as a rigid frame using localized heating to allow compliance about selectable axes along the lattice. The resulting shape of the lattice is modeled using product of exponentials kinematics to describe the serial chain of tunably compliant axes; this model is found to match the behavior of the physical test piece consisting of a Field’s metal (FM) lattice encased in silicone rubber. This concept could enable highly maneuverable robotic structures with significantly improved dexterity. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This paper presents a new motorized robotic bed mover with omnidirectional mobility to address this problem. This device is composed of an omnidirectional mobility unit, a force sensing-based human-machine interface, and control hardware with batteries and electronics. The proposed bed mover can be attached to the bottom of a manual hospital stretcher, transforming it into a powered omnidirectional bed (OmniBed) that can be used only by one person. The function of the OmniBed is compared with that of a conventional powered bed, which only provides forward assistance with a fifth powered wheel. We perform a pilot study with 14 subjects to evaluate the performance of this OmniBed and benefits for hospital application. The experimental results show that the OmniBed can half the manpower while decreasing back muscle activities, revealing the potential health benefits for older staffs. The OmniBed also shows the promising signs of high precision and handling in small spaces with its one-step 'parallel-parking' ability. This device is more ergonomic, more effective, and safer than the conventional powered bed. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Control of control moment gyroscopic actuators (CMGs) has been used for regulating the attitude of satellites, ships, vehicles, robots, and even humans for a long time. Generation of directional torques often causes the singularity problem that is strongly dependent on the direction of the momentum vector. Cooperative performances of controlling the magnitude and direction of CMGs can be achieved by both a human operator and a programmed system controller. A human-actuator collaborative control framework for CMGs is proposed by introducing a novel frequency-division control technique, which controls the magnitude and the direction of the torque separately in the frequency domain. The magnitude is controlled by the programmed system controller in the high frequency and the direction is controlled by a human operator in the low frequency. To realize such a frequency-division collaboration method between an actuator and a human operator, two CMGs are developed, and one is collaboratively controlled by another CMG manipulated by a human operator like a haptic device. The goal is to manipulate the direction of the momentum by transferring human inputs to the CMG. Defining impedance models of both actuators forms the bilateral transformation matrix that provides haptic and manipulation capabilities. The proposed method is verified through the experimental studies of two CMGs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

For this, we propose stiffness decomposition, which enables us to completely decompose the configuration space of the UATD robotic systems into the actuated space (with full actuation via active tendons) and the un-actuated space (with no actuation, only with passive compliance and contact wrench). The behavior in the actuated space is then fully-controllable, thus, the attainment of the desired behaviors, particularly those during the contact task, hinges upon that in the un-actuated space. For this, relying on the stiffness decomposition, we optimize the design parameters (e.g., tendon routing, pulley radius, passive compliance, etc.) to ensure the deformation in the un-actuated space as directional (e.g., for adaptive grasping) and minimized (e.g., pushing with posture maintained) for different contact wrench sets as possible, while also rendering the free motion to be as compliant and backdrivable as possible. The presented framework is then applied to design a UATD robotic finger and experimentally verified with the robot able to mimic the behavior of human index finger both during the free motion and pinch-pushing. © 2018 IEEE.},

This design eliminates the problems of planar snake robots to handle versatile motions with complex gait analysis, by leveraging Omni-directional motion capabilities of spherical robots. The robot is also capable of climbing smooth obstacles by introducing compliant joints in the links interconnecting adjacent modules.

A highly articulated helical interface is 3-D-printed with thermoactive functionally graded joints using a conventional 3-D printing device that utilizes UV curable acrylic plastic and hydroxylated wax as the primary and supporting material. The joint compliance is controlled by regulating wax temperature in phase transition. Empirical feed-forward control relations are identified through comprehensive study of the wax melting profile and actuation scenarios for different shaft designs to achieve desirable repeatability and response time. A decentralized control approach is employed by relating the mathematical terms of the Cosserat beam method to their morphological counterparts in which the manipulator local anisotropic stiffness is controlled based on the local stress and strain information. As a result, a minimalistic central controller is designed in which the joints' thermomechanical states are observed using a morphological observer, an external fully monitored replica of the observed system with the same inputs. Preliminary results for passive shape adaptation, geometrical disturbance rejection, and task space anisotropic stiffness control are reported by integrating the interface on a continuum manipulator. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Remote actuation is useful in human-interacting robots to reduce dynamic loading on distal joints. Cable-conduit transmissions, sometimes referred to as Bowden cable or tendon-sheath actuation, are a lightweight option for transferring power to a distal joint from a remotely located actuator. However, the nature of such transmissions causes the system to suffer from diminished efficiency and high reflected impedance as a result of distributed frictional effects between cable and conduit. A dynamic model is useful to produce controllers capable of accurately tracking force or displacement at the system's output. In this paper, we present a new computational model for cable-conduit systems that describes interaction with non-passive environments. Unlike previous models, our model features bi-directional propagation of motion within the cable-conduit system. This allows for simulation of human-interacting systems where both the human and the robot have the capability to impose motion or force. Because of this feature, the developed model is applicable to a wide range of physical systems. The model is validated in a physical prototype through experiments involving physical interaction with a human subject. We show that our model accurately predicts behaviors observed in the experimental system. © 2018 IEEE.},

With the proactive aspect, the robot is competent to predict the human's intent and perform an action without waiting for an instruction. The incremental aspect enables the robot to learn associations on the fly while performing a task. It is a probabilistic, statistically-driven approach. As a proof of concept, we focus on a table assembly task where the robot assists its human partner. We investigate how the accuracy of gesture detection affects the number of interactions required to complete the task.

	abstract = {Manta rays and stingrays have cartilaginous fins and disk-like bodies. Their unique shape facilitates efficient underwater locomotion. With inspiration of their natural evolution, the design and fabrication of a new ray inspired soft robot is presented. This soft robot is designed with a potential to perform underwater locomotion. An elastomeric soft body is developed by combining selective features of a manta ray and stingray. The concept is such that two of the side fins provide basic thrust and the third fin provides steering to the whole body. This three-fins concept is helpful for multi directional movement with minimal control adjustment. For actuation, each of three servo motors connects with a flexible cylindrical tendon. The actuation system is embedded within the elastomeric body of the ray robot. Without electronics installed, the body of the soft robot weights 36 g which is very light and suitable for locomotion by low power consumption. The soft fins are tested under controlled environments both outside and under water. The fin motion is tuned by investigating different flapping amplitudes and frequencies. By recording video of a fin motion, minor undulatory and major oscillatory motion components are observed across pectoral fins. The efficient pectoral fin gait is also identified by comparing the actuator power consumption for a fin flapping cycle. This work has shown that this new design of the soft ray robot can be an efficient swimming robot with design-and-material provided compliance. Further development would lead it to be a fully functional underwater exploratory robot. © 2018, Cefin Publishing House. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {For underwater robots in the past three decades, the problem of energy efficiency and acoustic noiselessness has arisen sharply. The solution of these problems is inextricably linked with the solution of the problems of dynamics and vibroacoustics arising in the flow of a liquid under the flow of underwater bodies. These problems include the problem of the pressure pulsations occurrence and velocity distributed over the surface of the object, as well as noise and vibrations caused by these pulsations. To create energy-efficient and low-noise underwater robots, it is necessary to create methods for influencing the structure of wall currents and the shape of the aerodynamic surfaces of the robot in order to reduce its surface friction, as well as impedance. In this paper, we consider the development of an experimental bench for testing the main executive systems of an underwater robot with an anisotropic hull, including a buoyancy variation system, a trim and roll change system, and a hull geometry changing system. © 2016},

	abstract = {Cooperation between surgeon and robot is one of the key technologies that limit the robot to be widely used in orthopedic clinics. In this study, the evolution of human-robot cooperation methods and the control strategies for typical human-robot cooperation in robot-assisted orthopedics surgery were reviewed at first. Then an intelligent admittance control method, which combines the fuzzy model reference learning control with the virtual constraint control, is proposed to solve the requirements of intuitive human-robot interaction during orthopedics surgery. That is, a variable damping parameter model of the admittance control based on fuzzy model learning control algorithm is introduced to make the robot move freely by using the reference model of surgeon’s motion equation with the minimum jerk trajectory. And the virtual constraint control method based on the principle of virtual fixture is adopted to make the robot move within the pre-defined area so as to perform more safe surgery. The basic principle and its realization of this intelligent control method are described in details. At last, a test platform is built based on our designed 6 DOF articulated robot. Experiments of safety and precision on acrylic model with this method show that the robot has the ability of better intuitive interaction and the high precision. And the pilot experiment of bone tumor resection on sawbone model shows the effectiveness of this method. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Continuing research efforts in robot-assisted rehabilitation demand more adaptable and inherently soft wearable devices. A wearable rehabilitative device is required to follow the motion of the body and to provide assistive or corrective motions to restore natural movements. Providing the required level of fluidity in wearable devices becomes a challenge for rehabilitation of more sensitive and fragile body parts, such as the face. To address this challenge, we propose a soft actuation method based on a tendon-driven robotic origami (robogami) and a soft sensing method based on a strain gauge with customized stretchable mesh design. The proposed actuation and sensing methods are compatible with the requirements in a facial rehabilitative device. The conformity of robogamis originates from their multiple and redundant degrees of freedom and the controllability of the joint stiffness, which is provided by adjusting the elasticity modulus of an embedded shape memory polymer (SMP) layer. The reconfiguration of the robogami and the trajectory and directional compliance of its end-effector are controlled by modulating the temperatures, hence the stiffness, of the SMP layers. Here we demonstrate this correlation using simulation and experimental results. In this paper, we introduce a thin and highly compliant sensing method for measuring facial movements with a minimal effect on the natural motions. The measurements of the sensors on the healthy side can be used to calculate the required tendon displacement for replicating the natural motion on the paralyzed side of the face in patients suffering from facial palsy. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Automated assembly, especially peg-in-hole insertion, is a common task in manufacturing. In particular, the high-precision assembly is achieved by high-precision manipulator and sensing system. However, uncertainty and various parts for assembly are still challenges for robotic assembly, especially for low-precision robot and sensors. It is noteworthy that human can implement assembly tasks although the precision of the arm and hand is not comparable with a common industrial robot, in which process compliance is the key characteristic of their motion. In this paper, we present a human-inspired compliant strategy for peg-in-hole assembly task using the environmental constraint and coarse force information. In the proposed strategy, a constraint region is designed for motion planning and utilized for eliminating the uncertainty of the initial positioning error of the peg. Force sensor is applied to sense the contact force of which the direction is used to adjust the movement of the peg. Therefore, high-precision sensor is not necessarily required. Inspired by human compliant assembly, a from coarse to fine adjustment strategy is executed. The contribution of our strategy is that high precision assembly task can be solved by low precision system. The constraint region and force guided directional adjustment have increased the robustness of the system. The strategy is carried out in simulation for round peg-in-hole assembly task. The experimental results show that the assembly task can be successfully completed and demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy. © 2017 IEEE.},

An energy-based model, which has learned to estimate the latent state from sensory signals, calculates energy values corresponding to occurrence proba- bilities of the signals; The lower the energy is, the higher the likelihood of them. Our method therefore selects the modality that provides the lowest expectation energy among available ones to exploit more frequent experiences. We employed a multimodal deep belief network to represent relationships be- tween humans' states and expressions. Our method demon- strated better performance for the modality selection than other methods in a task of emotion estimation.

Teleoperation represents a very complex sensory-motor task, mainly due to the kinematic and kinetic redundancies that characterize the human motor control. It requires an intensive training phase to acquire sufficient familiarity with the master-slave architecture. We estimated the hand stiffness modulation during the execution of a simulated suturing task in teleoperation, with two different master devices, and in free hand. Kinematic data of eight right-handed users were acquired, using electromagnetic and optical tracking systems, and analyzed using a musculoskeletal model. Through inverse dynamics, muscular activation was computed and used to obtain the joint torque and stiffness, leading to end-point stiffness estimation. The maximal stiffness value and its angular displacement with respect to the trajectory tangent were computed. The results show that there is a difference in how the main stiffness axis was modulated by using the two master devices with respect to free hand, with higher values and variability for the serial link manipulator. Moreover, a directional modulation of the hand stiffness through the trajectory was found, showing that the users were aligning the direction of the main stiffness axis perpendicularly to the trajectory. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the relationship between leg compliance and jumping performance in the false stick insect, this paper describes how variations in leg compliance and jumping direction affect the performance of a flea-inspired jumping mechanism. The amount of energy lost during jumping was determined by examining the ratio of kinetic energy to input energy (also called conversion efficiency). Leg compliance is modeled based on the compliant mechanics to determine energy transfer during jumping and determined the optimum degree of leg compliance for maximizing performance. Jumping experiments are then performed using six different legs with progressively greater degrees of stiffness and three different jumping directions. The experiments show that conversion efficiency decreases by approximately 3-5% as leg stiffness increases, compared to the optimal case. In the most compliant legs (i.e. stiffness of 0.0338 Nm rad<sup>-1</sup> or less), conversion efficiency rapidly drops to near 0% because the leg bends so much that it cannot support the thrusting force. The optimal conversion efficiency tends to increase when the mechanism jumps vertically owing to reduced slippage and increased ground reaction force. These investigations show that optimizing leg compliance can improve the performance of a jumping robot by up to 5% by enabling more of the initially stored energy in the leg to be used. This finding will likely prove helpful for choosing the leg stiffness for a small-scale jumping robot. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to consider the experimental and theoretical investigation of the vibratory alignment of the peg-hole, when the peg is fixed in the remote centre compliance (RCC) device, and the vibrations are provided either to the hole or to the peg. Design/methodology/approach - The experimental analysis of the circular and rectangular peg-hole vibratory alignment using the attached to the robot arm RCC device, under vibratory excitation of the hole, has been performed. The parameters of the vibratory excitation and the part-to-part pressing force influence on the alignment process have been analysed. The mathematical approach of the vibratory alignment using the passive compliance device with the vibrations provided to the peg has been proposed, and the simulation has been carried out. Findings - The research has approved the applicability of the RCC device for both of the vibratory alignments of the non-chamfered peg-hole parts either circular or rectangular ones. The compensation of the axial misalignments has been resulted by the directional displacement of the peg supported compliantly. To perform the successful alignment of the parts, it has been necessary to adjust the frequency and the amplitude of the vibrations, the pressing force, the lateral, as well as the angular stiffness of the device. Research limitations/implications - The experiments on the vibratory alignment of the rectangular peg-hole parts have been carried out considering only the translational misalignment moved into one direction. The non-impact regime of the vibratory alignment has been analysed. Practical implications - The obtained results can be applied in designing the reliable and efficient devices of the vibratory assembly for the alignment of the non-chamfered peg-hole parts, as well as for chamfered ones, if the axial misalignment exceeds the width of the chamfer. The vibratory technique and passive compliance provide possibility to accomplish the assembly operations using the non-expensive low accuracy robots. Originality/value - The new method and the mathematical approach of the vibratory assembly using the RCC device can ensure the reliable alignment of the non-chamfered parts, chamfered circular and the rectangular ones, in case the axial misalignment exceeds the assembly clearance, and prevent jamming and wedging. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The paper also presents the results of a 14-participant user study for both needle passing and knot tying sub-tasks, showing that virtual fixture assistance for novice users increases the needle passing exit point accuracy, reduces the number of errors (suture slip) in knot tying, and simultaneously decreases the task completion time and overall operator workload. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel semi-autonomous shared control framework based on an admittance configured haptic interface for bilateral teleoperation of VTOL aerial robots. A haptics-aided path planner and a virtual fixture based dynamic kinesthetic boundary (VFDKB) are proposed to better assist pilots to navigate through complex environments and perceive obstacle and path boundary. By combining the autonomous path planner and VFDKB, the novel framework maximizes autonomy and maintains flexibility to allow pilots to freely fly the robot with minimal effort for navigation and obstacle avoidance. The RRT based path planner uses the human operator's force input to dynamically determine the target position and heuristically bias the sampling process for better efficiency in finding a collision-free path. Cost functions are used to assess the difference between goal positions and generated paths for determining the replanning process and distance-optimal path. A virtual fixture based dynamic kinesthetic boundary prioritizes the haptic cue of more critical information between obstacles and path guidance virtual fixture (GVF) for pilot to achieve safe navigation. The theoretical analysis provides proof for guaranteed obstacle avoidance performance of the novel approach. Simulation and experimental study on an aerial robotic platform were conducted, and the outcomes confirm our claims. © 2016 TCCT.},

Detailed characterizations are specified to show the bending capability of the manipulator given different air pressure. Specifically, our manipulator, as thin as 6 mm, is able to achieve 360° directional bending, and, when given pressure over 70 kPa, it can reach 180° bending angle and around 5 mm bending radius easily. Due to its innate compliance and small dimension, this type of robotic manipulator can deliver safe and comfortable interactions with the subjects.

	abstract = {Physical human-robot interaction is fundamental to exploiting the capabilities of robots in tasks and environments where robots have limited cognition or comprehension and is virtually ubiquitous for robotic manipulation in highly unstructured environments, as are found in surgery. A critical aspect of physical human-robot interaction in these cases is controlling the robot so that the individual human and robot competencies are maximized, while guaranteeing user, task, and environment safety. Dissipative control precludes dangerous forcing of a shared tool by the robot, ensuring safety; however, it typically suffers from poor control fidelity, resulting in reduced task accuracy. In this study, a novel, rigorously formalized, n-dimensional dissipative control strategy is proposed that employs a new technique called 'energy redirection' to generate control forces with increased fidelity while remaining dissipative and safe. Experimental validation of the method, for complete pose control, shows that it achieves a 90% reduction in task error compared with the current state of the art in dissipative control for the tested applications. The findings clearly demonstrate that the method significantly increases the fidelity and efficacy of dissipative control during physical human-robot interaction. This advancement expands the number of tasks and environments into which safe physical human-robot interaction can be employed effectively. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

In this study, a redundantly actuated symmetrical PKM with five revolute (5R) joints is optimized for isotropic stiffness in the workspace. The stiffness of the 5R symmetrical PKM is calculated by the superposition of the actuator stiffness and the structural stiffness. We compared the stiffness of anon-redundant PKM and a redundant PKM. Compliance ellipses of the actuator stiffness and the structural stiffness of the non-redundant PKM resulted in the same configurations in the workspace, while those of the redundant PKM resulted in very different configurations. Optimization was performed by determining the optimal actuator torques that are needed to maximize the conditioning index. Optimal results considering structural stiffness can provide a more uniform directional stiffness than optimal results considering the index. When the strength of the linkages in a PKM is weak, the structural stiffness affects the actual stiffness considerably. We believe that the results of this study can be used to help design and control redundant PKMs. © © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

These demands come at the cost of a growing computational burden and, as a result, larger controller latencies. To maximize robustness to mechanical disturbances by maximizing control feedback gains, this paper emphasizes the necessity for compromise between high-and low-level feedback control efforts in distributed controllers. Specifically, the effect of distributed impedance controllers is studied, where damping feedback effort is executed in close proximity to the control plant and stiffness feedback effort is executed in a latency-prone centralized control process. A central observation is that the stability of high-impedance distributed controllers is very sensitive to damping feedback delay but much less to stiffness feedback delay. This study pursues a detailed analysis of this observation that leads to a physical understanding of the disparity. Then, a practical controller breakdown gain rule is derived to aim at enabling control designers to consider the benefits of implementing their control applications in a distributed fashion. These considerations are further validated through the analysis, simulation, and experimental testing on high-performance actuators and on an omnidirectional mobile base. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an omni-directional walking-aid robot is developed to assist the elderly in the daily living movements. A motion control strategy of walking-aid robot based on the observation of the human status through wearable sensors is proposed. During normal walking, the robot is controlled using a conventional admittance control scheme. When the tendency of a fall is detected, the robot will immediately react to prevent the user from falling down. The distance between the human Center of Pressure (COP) and the midpoint of the human feet is assumed to be a significant feature to detecting the fall events. When the user is in a quasi-static state or walking slowly, the COP can be approximated by the projection of Center of Gravity (COG) of the user's body. A simple and low-cost wearable sensor system is proposed to measure online the COG of the user. A limitation of the proposed wearable sensor system is that the Head-Arms-Torso (HAT) of the user is assumed to be always in upright position, which may generate measurement error. From comparison experiments with a reference optical system it is found that the measurement error is acceptable especially at the early stage of fall event. Dubois possibility theory is applied to describe the membership function of "normal walking" state. A threshold based fall detection approach is obtained from online evaluation of the walking status. Finally, experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Compliant human-robot interaction is necessary for the seamless integration of robotic devices into everyday life. Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a potential interface for compliant control due to the natural relationship between muscle activity and joint stiffness. Previous works have used sEMG to predict and control impedance along a single degree-of-freedom (DOF). However, humans interacting in unstable environments tune both the magnitude and direction of their impedance. This paper proposes a framework for multi-directional impedance control with sEMG to enhance compliant interactions. The framework allows subjects to simultaneously control both the direction of motion and primary stiffness axis of a robot, enabling stable behavior with controlled compliance to external forces. The efficacy of the approach is shown in a five day experiment with a 3-DOF virtual environment. Subjects displayed significant performance enhancements consistent with motor skill learning as they learned to follow paths and stay at desired targets while compensating for external forces. The framework is also demonstrated with compliant simultaneous and proportional control of a robot arm, suggesting the approach as a natural interface for enhancing capabilities of compliant human-robot interaction. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Restriction of pelvic lateral and rotation motions caused by robotic devices can hinder successful gait rehabilitation. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a novel pelvic motion supported over-ground robotic walker developed for gait training. This device consists of an omni-directional mobile platform, a pelvic and trunk motion support brace unit, and an intuitive human-machine interface with force/torque sensor. With this proposed device, over-ground walking with 6 degrees of freedom (DoFs) pelvic motion facilitation was achieved in an intuitive and natural way. Preliminary gait experiments were carried out on three conditions of free walking, walking with and without pelvic lateral and rotational motions in order to evaluate the feasibility of the walker. The results showed that gait with pelvic motion facilitation strongly resembled free over-ground walking without alteration of the normal gait dynamics, while gait with pelvic restriction led to gait performances with reduction in the range of motion of lower limb. The findings of this research revealed that the pelvic motion facilitation with developed walker can provide better functional outcomes for gait rehabilitation. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Effective physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) needs to account for variable human dynamics and also predict human intent. Recently, there has been a lot of progress in adaptive impedance and admittance control for human-robot interaction. Not as many contributions have been reported on online adaptation schemes that can accommodate users with varying physical strength and skill level during interaction with a robot. The goal of this paper is to present and evaluate a novel adaptive admittance controller that can incorporate human intent, nominal task models, as well as variations in the robot dynamics. An outer-loop controller is developed using an ARMA model which is tuned using an adaptive inverse control technique. An inner-loop neuroadaptive controller linearizes the robot dynamics. Working in conjunction and online, this two-loop technique offers an elegant way to decouple the pHRI problem. Experimental results are presented comparing the performance of different types of admittance controllers. The results show that efficient online adaptation of the robot admittance model for different human subjects can be achieved. Specifically, the adaptive admittance controller reduces jerk which results in a smooth human-robot interaction. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the phenomenon of directional efficiency, a property of spur gear transmissions in which the coefficient of torque dependent efficiency is function of the power flow direction; the efficiency in the step-up direction differs from that of step-down. Understanding the directional efficiency is important in robot design where the mechanical impedance of the transmission significantly affects the dynamics of physical interaction with the environment. This paper is the first to address 'backdrivability' by investigating directional efficiency on a high gear ratio robotic actuator, industrial servo gearboxes and over a family of gears. The kinematic model shows that a single pair of gears operates at higher efficiency in step-down than in step-up and the effect is confirmed in experiment, albeit with discrepancy in the magnitude of difference. Experimental results show that step-down and step-up directional efficiency are 98% and 96% respectively for a PIC DESIGNS 6/1 gearbox over the range of tested velocities. Additionally the overall energy efficiencies of the Dynamixel robotic servo motor with a gear ratio of 248/1 are approximately 75% and 70% for step-down and step-up respectively over a range of tested velocities. For the Dynamixel servo actuator, modeling with directional efficiency coefficients reduces error in predicted output force to 2-4% compared to a 4-8% with a single efficiency coefficient and 30% for models without friction. © 2015 IEEE.},

We study airbrush painting because it resembles in many ways manual welding, a standard industrial task. The experiments are performed with the 7 degrees of freedom KUKA lightweight robot arm. The robot is controlled in admittance using a force sensor attached at the end-point, so as to act as a free-mass and be passively guided by the human. For impedance measurements, a set of nine subjects perform 12 repetitions of airbrush painting, drawing a straight-line on a cartoon horizontally placed on a table, while passively moving the airbrush mounted on the robot's end-point. We measure hand impedance during the painting task by generating sudden and brief external forces with the robot. The results show that on average the dominant hand displays larger impedance than the nondominant in the directions perpendicular to the painting line. We find the most significant difference in the damping values in these directions. Based on this observation, we develop a "directional damping" scheme for robotic assistance and conduct a pilot study with 12 subjects to contrast airbrush painting with and without robotic assistance. Results show significant improvement in precision with both dominant and nondominant hands when using robotic assistance. © 2014 IEEE.},

The robot consists of a stick, a group of sensors and an omni-directional basis driven by three Swedish wheels. Multiple sensors were used to recognize the user’s “walking intention”, which is quantitatively described by a new concept called intentional direction (ITD). Based on the guidance of filtered ITD, a novel intentionbased admittance motion control (IBAC) scheme was proposed for the cane robot. The experiment results demonstrated that the user feels more natural and comfortable when walking with the assistance of cane robot controlled by the IBAC strategy. To detect the fall of user, a detection method based on Dubois possibility theory was proposed using the combined sensor information from force sensors and a laser ranger finder (LRF) fixed on the cane robot. The human fall model was represented in a two-dimensional space, where the relative position between the Zero- Moment-Point (ZMP) and the center of support triangle was utilized as a significant feature. The effectiveness of proposed fall detection method was also confirmed by experiments. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {Neurological or biomechanical disorders may distort ankle mechanical impedance and thereby impair locomotor function. This paper presents a quantitative characterization of multivariable ankle mechanical impedance of young healthy subjects when their muscles were relaxed, to serve as a baseline to compare with pathophysiological ankle properties of biomechanically and/or neurologically impaired patients. Measurements using a highly backdrivable wearable ankle robot combined with multi-input multi-output stochastic system identification methods enabled reliable characterization of ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) simultaneously, the sagittal and frontal planes. The characterization included important ankle properties unavailable from single DOF studies: coupling between DOFs and anisotropy as a function of frequency. Ankle impedance in joint coordinates showed responses largely consistent with a second-order system consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both seated (knee flexed) and standing (knee straightened) postures. Stiffness in the sagittal plane was greater than in the frontal plane and furthermore, was greater when standing than when seated, most likely due to the stretch of bi-articular muscles (medial and lateral gastrocnemius). Very low off-diagonal partial coherences implied negligible coupling between dorsiflexion-plantarflexion and inversion-eversion. The directions of principal axes were tilted slightly counterclockwise from the original joint coordinates. The directional variation (anisotropy) of ankle impedance in the 2-D space formed by rotations in the sagittal and frontal planes exhibited a characteristic 'peanut' shape, weak in inversion-eversion over a wide range of frequencies from the stiffness dominated region up to the inertia dominated region. Implications for the assessment of neurological and biomechanical impairments are discussed. © 2014 IEEE.},

Tensegrity robots provide many advantages over standard robots, such as compliance, robustness, and flexibility. Moreover, sphere-shaped tensegrity robots can provide non-traditional modes of locomotion, such as rolling. While they have advantageous physical properties, tensegrity robots are hard to control because of their nonlinear dynamics and oscillatory nature. In this paper, we present a robust, distributed, and directional rolling algorithm, 'flop and roll'. The algorithm uses coevolution and exploits the distributed nature and symmetry of the tensegrity structure. We validate this algorithm using the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit (NTRT) simulator, as well as the highly accurate model of the physical SUPERBall being developped under the NASA Innovative and Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. Flop and roll improves upon previous approaches in that it provides rolling to a desired location. It is also robust to both unexpected external forces and partial hardware failures. Additionally, it handles variable terrain (hills up to 33% grade). Finally, results are compatible with the hardware since the algorithm relies on realistic sensing and actuation capabilities of the SUPERBall. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Humans have the inherent ability to perform highly dexterous tasks with their arms, involving maintenance of posture, movement, and interaction with the environment. The latter requires the human to control the dynamic characteristics of the upper limb musculoskeletal system. These characteristics are quantitatively represented by inertia, damping, and stiffness, which are measures of mechanical impedance. Many previous studies have shown that arm posture is a dominant factor in determining the end point impedance on a horizontal plane. This paper presents the characterization of the end point impedance of the human arm in 3-D space. Moreover, it models the regulation of the arm impedance with muscle cocontraction. The characterization is made by route of experimental trials where human subjects maintained arm posture while their arms were perturbed by a robot arm. Furthermore, the subjects were asked to control the level of their arm muscles' cocontraction, using visual feedback, in order to investigate the effect of muscle cocontraction on the arm impedance. The results of this study show an anisotropic increase of arm stiffness due to muscle cocontraction. These results could improve our understanding of the human arm biomechanics, as well as provide implications for human motor control - specifically the control of arm impedance through muscle cocontraction. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

In addition to reducing hand tremor and improving tool positioning, a robotic assistant can provide assistive motion guidance using virtual fixtures, and incorporate real-time feedback from intraocular force sensing ophthalmic instruments to present tissue manipulation forces, that are otherwise physically imperceptible to the surgeon. This paper presents the design of an FBG-based, multi-function instrument that is capable of measuring mN-level forces at the instrument tip located inside the eye, and also the sclera contact location on the instrument shaft and the corresponding contact force. The given information is used to augment cooperatively controlled robot behavior with variable admittance control. This effectively creates an adaptive remote center-of-motion (RCM) constraint to minimize eye motion, but also allows the translation of the RCM location if the instrument is not near the retina. In addition, it provides force scaling for sclera force feedback. The calibration and validation of the multifunction force sensing instrument are presented, along with demonstration and performance assessment of the variable admittance robot control on an eye phantom. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is commonly used in pediatric operations. This method greatly benefits patients because of the reduced surgical trauma. To perform such surgery smoothly, doctors must be highly skilled. To reduce operating difficulties, a great deal of research on surgical systems have been carried out. However, in some cases, smaller workspaces limit the application of MIS. For example, the workspace of infant congenital esophageal atresia (ICEA) surgery is only around 30×30×30 mm. Until now, most ICEA surgeries have been manually performed with traditional instruments. This paper presents a smart surgical robot (SSR) for ICEA surgery. The robot is composed of two slave arms, each consisting of a positioning manipulator and a surgical tool manipulator. The positioning manipulator uses a selective compliance assembly robot arm (SCARA) and a screw-pair mechanism to achieve translational movement in 3D space, and the surgical tool manipulator uses a 'double screw drive + universal joint' structure to allow an omni directional bending motion. During surgery, the surgeon first creates the workspace manually to explore the target esophagus. The SSR system is then applied to perform operation. The configuration of the SSR means it can perform tissue manipulation under endoscopic view in a small workspace. Experimental results show that the endoscopic view permits the SSR system to be operated intuitively and accurately in the target workspace. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: In a deforming anatomic environment, the motion of an instrument suffers from complex geometrical and dynamic constraints, robot assisted minimally invasive surgery therefore requires more sophisticated skills for surgeons. This paper proposes a novel dynamic virtual fixture (DVF) to enhance the surgical operation accuracy of admittance-type medical robotics in the deforming environment.Methods: A framework for DVF on the Euclidean Group SE(3) is presented, which unites rotation and translation in a compact form. First, we constructed the holonomic/non-holonomic constraints, and then searched for the corresponded reference to make a distinction between preferred and non-preferred directions. Second, different control strategies are employed to deal with the tasks along the distinguished directions. The desired spatial compliance matrix is synthesized from an allowable motion screw set to filter out the task unrelated components from manual input, the operator has complete control over the preferred directions; while the relative motion between the surgical instrument and the anatomy structures is actively tracked and cancelled, the deviation relative to the reference is compensated jointly by the operator and DVF controllers. The operator, haptic device, admittance-type proxy and virtual deforming environment are involved in a hardware-in-the-loop experiment, human-robot cooperation with the assistance of DVF controller is carried out on a deforming sphere to simulate beating heart surgery, performance of the proposed DVF on admittance-type proxy is evaluated, and both human factors and control parameters are analyzed.Results: The DVF can improve the dynamic properties of human-robot cooperation in a low-frequency (0 ~ 40 rad/sec) deforming environment, and maintain synergy of orientation and translation during the operation. Statistical analysis reveals that the operator has intuitive control over the preferred directions, human and the DVF controller jointly control the motion along the non-preferred directions, the target deformation is tracked actively.Conclusions: The proposed DVF for an admittance-type manipulator is capable of assisting the operator to deal with skilled operations in a deforming environment. © 2014 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {An omni-directional walking control method for a six-legged robot is established by considering the dynamics of the actuator. We constructed a mathematical model in which the inputs were the driving torque of the rotating links in the support legs and the outputs were the x, y-positions of the body and the yawing angle. An LQI control system was designed. By using a 3D model of the six-legged robot, the effectiveness of the proposed control method was examined in the case that the reference orbit was a semicircle of 0.5 m in radius. As a result, the validity of the proposed control method was confirmed. © 2014 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.},

	abstract = {An intelligent cane robot was designed for aiding the elderly and handicapped people walking. The robot consists of a stick, a group of sensors and an omni-directional basis driven by three Swedish wheels. Multiple sensors were used to recognize the user's 'walking intention', which is quantitatively described by a new concept called intentional direction (ITD). Based on the guidance of filtered ITD, a novel intention-based admittance motion control (IBAC) scheme was proposed for the cane robot. To detect the fall of user, a detection method based on Dubois possibility theory was proposed using the combined sensor information from force sensors, a laser ranger finder (LRF) and an on-shoe load sensor. The human fall model was represented in a two-dimensional space, where the relative position between the center of pressure (COP) and the center of support triangle was utilized as a significant feature. The effectiveness of proposed fall detection method was also confirmed by experiments. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel omnidirectional walking engine that achieves energy efficient, human like, stable and fast walking. We augment the 3D inverted pendulum with a spring model to implement a height change in the robot’s center of mass trajectory. This model is used as simplified model of the robot and the zero moment point (ZMP) criterion is used as the stability indicator. The presented walking engine consists of 5 main modules including the “next posture generator” module, the “foot trajectory generator” module, the “center of mass (CoM) trajectory generator” module, the “robot posture controller” module and “Inverse kinematics (IK) solver” module. The focus of the paper is the generation of the position of the next step and the CoM trajectory generation. For the trajectory generator, we extend the 3D-IPM with an undamped spring to implement height changes of the CoM. With this model we can implement active compliance for the robot’s gait, resulting in a more energy efficient movement. We present a modified method for solving ZMP equations which derivation is based on the new proposed model for omnidirectional walking. The walk engine is tested on simulated and a real NAO robot. We use policy search to optimize the parameters of the walking engines for the standard 3D-LIPM and our proposed model to compare the performance of both models each with their optimal parameters. We optimize the policy parameters in terms of energy efficiency for a fixed walking speed. The experimental results show the advantages of our proposed model over 3D-LIPM. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

	abstract = {In the near future, humans and robots are expected to perform collaborative tasks involving physical interaction in various different environments such as homes, hospitals, and factories. One important research topic in physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) is to develop tacit and natural haptic communication between the partners. Although there are already several studies in the area of Human-Robot Interaction, the number of studies investigating the physical interaction between the partners and in particular the haptic communication are limited and the interaction in such systems is still artificial when compared to natural human-human collaboration. Although the tasks involving physical interaction such as the table transportation can be planned and executed naturally and intuitively by two humans, there are unfortunately no robots in the market that can collaborate and perform the same tasks with us. In this study, we propose a new controller for the robotic partner that is designed to a) detect the intentions of the human partner through haptic channel using a fuzzy controller b) adjust its contribution to the task via a variable impedance controller and c) resolve the conflicts during the task execution by controlling the internal forces. The results of the simulations performed in Simulink/Matlab show that the proposed controller is superior to the stand-alone standard/variable impedance controllers.},

	abstract = {Active constraints, also known as virtual fixtures, are high-level control algorithms which can be used to assist a human in man-machine collaborative manipulation tasks. The active constraint controller monitors the robotic manipulator with respect to the environment and task, and anisotropically regulates the motion to provide assistance. The type of assistance offered by active constraints can vary, but they are typically used to either guide the user along a task-specific pathway or limit the user to within a "safe" region. There are several diverse methods described within the literature for applying active constraints, and these are surveyed within this paper. The active constraint research is described and compared using a simple generalized framework, which consists of three primary processes: 1) constraint definition, 2) constraint evaluation, and 3) constraint enforcement. All relevant research approaches for each of these processes, found using search terms associated to "virtual fixture, " "active constraint" and 'motion constraint,' are presented. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An omni-directional walking-aid robot is developed for the elderly in this study. A motion control strategy of walking-aid robot based on observing human status by wearable sensors is proposed. During normal walking, the robot is controlled by a conventional admittance control scheme. When the tendency of a fall is detected, the robot will immediately react to prevent the user from falling down. The distance between the human Centre of Pressure (COP) and the midpoint of two human feet is assumed to be a significant feature to detecting the fall events. Dubois possibility theory is applied to describe the membership function of 'normal walking' state. A threshold based fall detection approach is obtained from online evaluation of the walking status. Finally, experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy.},

	abstract = {Humans have the inherent ability of performing highly dexterous and skillful tasks with their arms, involving maintenance of posture, movement, and interaction with the environment. The latter requires the human to control the dynamic characteristics of the upper limb musculoskeletal system. These characteristics are quantitatively represented by inertia, damping, and stiffness, which are measures of mechanical impedance. Many previous studies have shown that arm posture is a dominant factor in determining the end point impedance on a horizontal (transverse) plane. This paper presents the characterization of the end point impedance of the human arm in three-dimensional space. Moreover, it models the regulation of the arm impedance with respect to various levels of muscle co-contraction. The characterization is made by route of experimental trials where human subjects maintained arm posture while their arms were perturbed by a robot arm. Furthermore, the subjects were asked to control the level of their arm muscles' co-contraction, using visual feedback of their muscles' activation, in order to investigate the effect of this muscle co-contraction on the arm impedance. The results of this study show a very interesting, anisotropic increase of arm stiffness due to muscle co-contraction. These results could lead to very useful conclusions about the human's arm biomechanics, as well as many implications for human motor controlspecifically the control of arm impedance through muscle cocontraction.

However, none of the configurations analyzed to date involve "dual-reeving," a common industrial rigging technique whereby cables are spatial loops, vs. openloop elements, such as those represented by simple line segments. The 4-node/4-loop kinematic configuration analyzed contains 4 symmetric nodes and loops and provides competition for a comparable-sized Stewart platform from the perspective of directional stiffness. Additionally, like the Stewart platform, only a modest amount of off-diagonal compliance matrix elements are present, which from a practical and intuitive point of view, can be advantageous. The methodology used and illustrated in detail is easily generalized to adapt to more involved configurations. Numerical results are obtained for a specific example and compared with those from a Stewart platform. Lastly, some experimental results compare favorably with those derived analytically and evaluated numerically. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

	abstract = {The development of the notion of virtual fixture originated the broader concept of robot haptic guidance, meaning a recent technology to support motor learning. It has been applied in many areas, namely on automotive assembly, medical rehabilitation and training of healthy people. The implementation of virtual fixtures depends on the robot mechanical and drive system, namely the type of actuators and transmissions. If non-backdriven transmissions are used the operator controls the robot through the forces he/she exerts on the robot handle (which are measured by a force transducer incorporated at the robot end-effector). These robots usually use motors with large reduction ratios and are admittance controlled. In this paper we implement haptic guidance in an impedance type three degree-of-freedom (dof) heavy robot. An admittance low-level controller is firstly designed based on an IP (Integral, Proportional) velocity controller. Two types of virtual fixtures are implemented and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated experimentally. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

This robot is designed to achieve high speed, high payload, and dexterous motions that are typical drawbacks of previous climbing robots. Each module is designed as a tread-wheeled mechanism to simultaneously realize high speed and high adhesive force. Two modules are connected by compliant joints, which induce a positive preload on the front wheels resulting in stable climbing and high payload capacity. Compliant joints also help the robot to perform various transitions. An active tail is adopted to regulate the preload of the second module. Force transfer equations are derived and stable operating conditions are verified. The stiffness coefficients of the compliant joints and the active tail force are determined optimally to satisfy the constraints of stable operation. The prototype two-module robot achieves 6-cm/\hbox{s} speed and 500-g payload capacity on vertical surfaces. The abilities of flat surface locomotion, internal, external, and thin-wall transitions, and overcoming various sized obstacles are validated through experiment. The principle of joint compliance can be adopted in other climbing robots to enhance their stability and transition capability. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we introduce methods to improve the base performance of the Active Handrest's linear admittance controller (V = K <inf>a</inf> * F) based on knowledge of user intention, through adaptive admittance, and knowledge of the environment, via virtual fixtures. Herein, we present feasibility studies to apply adaptive admittance and virtual fixtures to the motion of the Active Handrest and measure user performance. We introduce a more relevant evaluation task for the Active Handrest by conducting experiments involving the navigation of virtual labyrinths. The results of these experiments show that adaptive admittance improves a user's ability to accurately navigate a narrow labyrinth, with less cost of time than using constant gains with a linear admittance controller. Additionally, a feasibility study on virtual fixtures shows that user performance for drawing straight lines with virtual fixtures applied directly to the Active Handrest is equivalent to user performance with virtual fixtures applied directly to the grasped tool, as has been done more traditionally. These results underscore the utility of the Active Handrest as they show the potential to achieve highly accurate motions without the need for a robotically enabled or co-manipulated tool. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a novel finger mechanism that enables a robot to perform a gentle and dexterous motion. This finger contains three joints, in which the proximal (PIP) and distal intraphalangeal (DIP) joints are coupled rigidly, and the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint has a multidirectional passive compliance that is adjustable as in humans. In the MP joint, two kinds of silicone-rubber cushions (A-SRC and B-SRC) are placed between a motor-driven disk and an output link. A-SRC plays three roles: 1) transmission of the rotational motion from the motor to the output link by the friction force between the surface of A-SRC and the motor-driven disk; 2) absorption of external forces from multiple directions by its elastic deformation; and 3) sensing the directions and magnitudes of external forces with the change in inside pressure. B-SRC adjusts the characteristics of joint compliance by pressing A-SRC against the motor-driven disk. We investigate the basic performance of this finger module through several experiments. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Adaptive compliance control strategy can be a significant advantage for control of steer-by-wire systems. Initially the method is proposed for robotic applications where the main concern is the interaction forces between the robot and its environment. There are several studies about cooperative working of a robot and a human. As long as the steering system is a part of the vehicle where driver interaction is involved, it is reasonable to think that compliance control strategies can be adapted to steer-by-wire systems. Compliance control is a model reference control (MRC) strategy where the measured external force/torque is used as an input to a reference model to calculate its output and where the real system is controlled appropriately to track the reference system output. If a sensor is available to measure the external force/torque, system parameters need not to be estimated. A constant gain feedback controller can be used in such a case. However, if the parameter variations of the system are not within certain bounds, a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) is needed. In addition to this, examining the change in the dynamics of the system due to the compliance of the driver arms is not possible by direct MRAC, because the driver effect is considered as a disturbance in this strategy. Therefore, in this study, instead of estimating controller parameters using direct MRAC where the main concern is the tracking performance, it is considered to use indirect MRAC in which the system parameters are estimated to observe their variations in the presence of parametric uncertainty and disturbances and to further examine the change in the dynamics of the system due to the compliance of the driver arms forming a closed kinematic structure by constraining the steering wheel. Hence, a steer-by-wire experimental setup including driver interaction and vehicle directional control units has been developed and three well-known adaptive on-line estimation methods, which are output-error method, equation-error method and modified recursive least squares method are evaluated on the driver interaction unit. These three methods are compared in terms of computational complexity, convergence, stability and applicability to real vehicles. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Realizing the transitions by an using under-actuated system without complex control is another contribution of this research. The robot is driven using a tread-wheel mechanism made of a flat sticky polymer to realize fast and robust climbing. Directional compliant joints are used between the two modules to increase the preload on each front wheel. An active tail is used at the end of the second module to compensate for the negative effects of the compliant joint forces. This combination of directional compliant joints and active tail also allows the robot to perform various internal and external transitions passively. The induced positive preload on the front wheels are analyzed and verified. Three types of internal transition and three types of external transition including a thin-wall transition are achieved by the robot prototype. The concept of the directional compliance with the active tail can be adopted to other climbing robots to enhance robustness and mobility. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A persistent - if less glamorous - challenge in hospitals lies in the day-to-day work of moving and lifting patients with impaired mobility. This is a challenge intensified by our burgeoning aging population, the obesity epidemic, and our aging healthcare workforce. During manual patient handling, the predominant risk of staff injury is excessive back and shoulder loading. A mobile robotic nurse assistant (RoNA) is highly desired to enhance the efficacy and quality of care that nurses and their paraprofessional staff can provide. Such an assistant could improve a nurse's working conditions by off-loading some of his or her most physically demanding duties, thereby reducing the potential for self-injury or injury to the patient. Hstar Technologies is developing a revolutionary RoNA system that provides physical assistance to nurses in a hospital ward. The design of RoNA is a safe and robust system that works effectively in a hospital environment under direct and telepresence control by a nurse or physician. RoNA has a humanoid design featuring bimanual dexterous manipulators that employ a series-elastic-actuation (SEA) system. These electric actuators provide manipulator compliance, safety, flexibility and the strength to lift patients weighing up to 300lbs. RoNA also features an innovative humanoid upper torso, a unique mobile platform with holonomic drive and posture stability enhancement, intelligent navigation control with 3D sensing and perception capability, an intuitive and innovative human-robot interaction control interface, and a highly integrated plan for healthcare system assembly. We anticipate that robotic maneuvering assistants would increase job satisfaction, reduce lifting-related injuries, and extend the years of effective service nurses could render in hospitals. These effects would reduce hospital costs and ameliorate problems posed by the shortage of nursing staff. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Quantitative characterization of ankle mechanical impedance is important to understand how the ankle supports lower-extremity functions during interaction with the environment. This paper reports a novel procedure to characterize static multivariable ankle mechanical impedance. An experimental protocol using a wearable therapeutic robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable measurement of torque and angle data in multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously, a combination of inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion. The measured multivariable torque-angle relation was represented as a vector field, and approximated using a method based on thin-plate spline smoothing with generalized cross validation. The vector field enabled assessment of several important characteristics of static ankle mechanical impedance, which are not available from prior single degree of freedom studies: the directional variation of ankle mechanical impedance, the extent to which the ankle behaves as a spring, and evidence of uniquely neural contributions. The method was validated by testing a simple physical "mock-up" consisting of passive elements. Experiments with young unimpaired subjects quantified the behavior of the maximally relaxed human ankle, showing that ankle mechanical impedance is spring-like but strongly direction-dependent, being weakest in inversion. Remarkably, the analysis was sufficiently sensitive to detect a subtle but statistically significant deviation from spring-like behavior if subjects were not fully relaxed. This method may provide new insight about the function of the ankle, both unimpaired and after biomechanical or neurological injury. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Collision-based expenditure of mechanical energy and the compliance and geometry of the leg are fundamental, interrelated considerations in the mechanical design of legged runners. This article provides a basic context and rationale for experiments designed to inform each of these key areas in Boston Dynamic's BigDog robot. Although these principles have been investigated throughout the past few decades within different academic disciplines, BigDog required that they be considered together and in concert with an impressive set of control algorithms that are not discussed here. Although collision reduction is an important strategy for reducing mechanical cost of transport in the slowest and fastest quadrupedal gaits, walking and galloping, BigDog employed an intermediate-speed trotting gait without collision reduction. Trotting, instead, uses a spring-loaded inverted pendulum mechanism with potential for storage and return of elastic strain energy in appropriately compliant structures. Rather than tuning BigDog's built-in leg springs according to a spring-mass model-based virtual leg-spring constant, a much stiffer distal leg spring together with actuation of the adjacent joint provided good trotting dynamics and avoided functional limitations that might have been imposed by too much compliance in real-world terrain. Adjusting the directional compliance of the legs by adopting a knee-forward, elbow-back geometry led to more robust trotting dynamics by reducing perturbations about the pitch axis of the robot's center of mass (CoM). BigDog is the most successful large-scale, all-terrain trotting machine built to date and it continues to stimulate our understanding of legged locomotion in comparative biomechanics as well as in robotics. © The Author 2011.

Voluntary muscle activation has a significant impact on ankle impedance, increasing it by up to a factor of three in our experiments. Furthermore, significant asymmetries and deviations from a linear two-spring model are present in many subjects, indicating that ankle impedance has a complex and individually idiosyncratic structure. We propose the use of Fourier series as a general representation, providing both insight and a precise quantitative characterization of human static ankle impedance. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.},

This paper presents a human-friendly robot arm designed so as to realize a physical interaction with human safely. This arm has a 3-D.O.F (shoulder joint : 2-D.O.F, elbow joint : 1-D.O.F). To guarantee the safety of robot motion, elbow joint has a multi-directional passive compliance. In this joint, two kinds of air cushions (Cushion A and Cushion B) are placed between a motor-driven disk and an output link. The rotational motion of the motor is transmitted to the output link with the friction force between the surface of Cushion A and the motor-driven disk. In addition, Cushion A plays following two important roles: (1) Absorption of external forces by its elastic deformation and slippage on the motor-driven disk and (2) Sensing the directions and amplitude of external forces with the pressure change in it. On the other hand, Cushion B controls the degree of pressing Cushion A against the motor-driven disk by its expansion. The increment of pressing force of Cushion A results in the increment of joint stiffness, because the elastic deformation and slippage of Cushion A are prevented.

	abstract = {Nanotech is at the scale of 10<sup>-9</sup> meters, located at the mesocopic transition phase, which can take both classical mechanics (CM) and quantum mechanics (QM) descriptions bridging ten orders of magnitude phenomena, between the microscopic world of a single atom at 10<sup>-10</sup> meters with the macroscopic world at meters. However, QM principles aid the understanding of any unusual property at the nanotech level. The other major difference between nano-photonics and other forms of optics is that the nano-scale is not very 'hands on'. For the most part, we will not be able to see the components with our naked eyes, but will be required to use some nanotech imaging tools, as follows: (1) Electron Scanning Microscope (through a focusing lens of positive refractive index material). (2) Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM, (de Broglie Wave for dry metallic materials). (3) X-ray Laser Photons: Specifically, Los Alamos Lab has produced the world record for the shortest wavelength X-ray laser for coherent imaging of atoms. (4) Nature photonics is an inspiration, a proof of existence in nano-scales: e.g. reflection-free glare-less Moth'fs eye, dirt-free lily flower emerging from a muddy pond, sucking setae of scalping gecko, etc. (5) Evanescence Wave Imaging: the detail evanescence decaying waves become a propagating imaging focusing wave in case of a negative dielectric constant, such as made possible at the anisotropic dielectric material which might produce a negative transversal index ε<inf>⊥</inf> <sup>2</sup>=∥ε<inf>o</inf>∥<sup>2</sup>- ε<inf>∥</inf><sup>2</sup>; or the optical surface optical Plasmon reactive interaction, or man-made slit ring :"letter C" at the long-long infrared at hundreds THz complex impedance. The nano-manipulator (NanoRobot) has combined both "touching-feeling" and "pushing-moving" in a design, which supports electrically multiplexing using a compounded piezoelectric cantilever layers with single crystal tips/. This manipulator is augmented with the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), after a detailed blue-print made by STM imaging. As an application, we review (i) a simple self-consistency derivation of the Wallance'fs band-gap formulae for Single Wall CNT; (ii) the prototype of non-cryogenic dual infrared spectrum cameras made of the semiconductor Carbon NanoTube (CNT), and (iii) the high efficient solar voltaic cells made of a stack of rotated staircase of CNT'fs. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

In this paper, we extend this framework to support autonomous motion of the robot's omni-directional base both before and during pulling. With our new methods, we show that the robot can autonomously approach and open doors and drawers for which only the location and orientation of the handle have been provided. We also demonstrate that EPC can coordinate the movement of the robot's omni-directional base and compliant arm while pulling open a door or drawer, which leads to significantly improved performance. Through 40 trials with 10 different doors and drawers, we empirically demonstrated the robustness of the system. The robot succeeded in 37 out of 40 trials, and had no more than a single failure for any particular door or drawer. ©2010 IEEE.},

We consider the characteristics of the servo brakes and control the brake torque of each wheel based on the brake force/moment constraint so that several motion functions of PRP are realized based on the applied force. This allows PRP to track a path which includes motion perpendicular to the pushing direction of the human without using servo motors. The impedance-based motion control is also realized with respect to the perpendicular to the pushing direction. These functions are implemented on PRP experimentally, and the experimental results illustrate the validity of PRP and its control method. © 2009 VSP.},

The robot compliance here refers to the structural elastic deformation of the device. The high mechanical stiffness and non-backdrivability of a typical admittance-controlled robot allow for slow and precise motions, making it highly suitable for tasks that require accuracy near human physical limits, such as microsurgery. However, previous experiments have shown that even small robot compliance degraded virtual fixture performance, especially at the micro scale. In this work, control methods to minimize the effect of robot compliance on virtual fixture performance were developed for admittance-controlled cooperative systems. Based on a linear model of the robot dynamics, we applied a Kalman filter to integrate the measurements obtained from the camera and encoders to estimate the robot end-effector position. A partitioned control law was used to achieve end-effector trajectory following on the desired velocity commanded by the admittance and virtual fixture control laws. The effectiveness of the Kalman filter and the controller was validated on a one degree-of-freedom admittance-controlled cooperative testbed. ©2008 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With few exceptions, most of the existing noise reduction and data segmentation algorithms are only suited to image data. Therefore, an adaptive smoothing algorithm, with model-based masks, within a scale space framework is proposed for range data in this paper. This algorithm smoothes range data that conform to predefined, geometric models, while leaving other data points unaffected. The convergence of the algorithm in yielding dominant features is shown based on its compliance with the anisotropic diffusion concept. The weights of the smoothing masks are adaptively calculated according to the Mahalanobis distances between range data and model-based predictions. These behave as the diffusion coefficient in the anisotropic diffusion equation, thus satisfying the requirements of the causality criterion that no new features are introduced from fine to coarse scales. The computational complexity of this algorithm is examined and compared to that of the well-known RANSAC feature extraction algorithm. Unlike RANSAC, it has the advantage that the computational complexity is less affected by increasing the order of the model, and is independent of the number of model outliers. The proposed algorithm can be used to smooth range data in multiscale space by increasing the number of smoothing iterations. Robust, robot-occlusion-invariant features are then easily extracted from the smoothed data by least squares fitting algorithms. © 2008 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in dynamic legged locomotion have focused on encoding a substantial component of leg intelligence into passive compliant mechanisms. One of the limitations of this approach is reduced adaptability: the final leg mechanism usually performs optimally for a small range of conditions (i.e. a certain robot weight, terrain, speed, gait, and so forth). For many situations in which a small locomotion system experiences a change in any of these conditions, it is desirable to have a variable stiffness leg to tune the natural frequency of the system for effective gait control. In this paper, we present an overview of variable stiffness leg spring designs, and introduce a new approach specifically for autonomous dynamic legged locomotion. We introduce a simple leg model that captures the spatial compliance of the tunable leg in three dimensions. Lastly, we present the design and manufacture of the multi-directional variable stiffness legs, and experimentally validate their correspondence to the proposed model. Copyright © 2007 by ASME.},

Foremost among the design features are multiple levels of compliance, at length scales ranging from centimeters to micrometers, to allow the robot to conform to surfaces and maintain large real areas of contact so that adhesive forces can support it. Structures within the feet ensure even stress distributions over each toe and facilitate engagement and disengagement of the adhesive materials.

To correct this, a set of methods, called Dynamically-Defined Virtual Fixtures, was previously proposed to create a movable virtual fixture that stops the user at a safe distance outside the forbidden region. In this work, a new method, called the Force-Based Method, was added. A vision system was introduced for real-time tool tracking. Additionally, we implemented a closed-loop controller with the virtual fixtures that allows the user to reach, but not enter, the forbidden region. Two user experiments were conducted on a 1-DOF testbed to evaluate the virtual fixture methods. The first experiment showed the effectiveness of the virtual fixtures in preventing the penetration. However, the absence of haptic feedback in the closed-loop implementation resulted in boundary penetration. In the second experiment, visual feedback was used to compensate for the lack of haptic feedback. User cognitive load was added as an inhibiting factor in a human-machine cooperative setting. The experiment showed a significant reduction in penetration with visual feedback, while the addition of cognitive load did not significantly increase the penetration. © 2007 IEEE.},

We analyze the singularity of PRP braking torques, and control the brake torque of each wheel based on the brake force/moment constraint so that impedance characteristics is realized on PRP with human's pushing. This allows a PRP to track a 2D path which includes motion perpendicular to human's pushing direction without using servo motors, and multi-PRPs to work cooperatively on handling a single object with orientation control for avoiding collision with obstacles.

	abstract = {Using the gecko as inspiration, important principles are revealed for reliable maneuvering on vertical surfaces. Foremost among these is the directional behavior of the gecko adhesive system, which permits control of adhesion via control of the tangential forces at the feet. Multiple hierarchical levels of compliance are also important for conforming intimately to surfaces with varying degrees of roughness and different length scales. In light of these requirements, most previously developed synthetic adhesives are not well suited for application on a climbing robot. We describe a synthetic fibrillar adhesive, termed Directional Polymer Stalks, made from relatively soft polyurethane (modulus of elasticity ≈ 300 kPa). The fibrils are angled 20° with respect to vertical and are approximately 1 mm long and 380 μm in diameter. Rather than having a flat top, they have angled faces at 45°. The directional nature of these angled stalks is shown, achieving a maximum adhesion of approximately 1 N for a 3.9 cm<sup>2</sup> patch when pulled in the direction in which the stalks are angled. When pulled in the non-adhesive direction, the adhesion forces are negligible. The application to a climbing robot is presented and limitations of the current design are discussed along with ongoing efforts to address them. © 2007 VSP.},

Pseudo-admittance control has potential benefits for tasks that require better-than-human levels of precision, as well as with systems that are typically run under rate control. The controller can also be modified to include virtual fixtures that provide guidance during task execution, while leaving ultimate control of the system with the operator.

	abstract = {In human-machine interfaces with joint/link compliance, human hand dynamics can have a detrimental effect on system performance. This paper investigates the effect of human dynamics on the effectiveness of a virtual fixture implemented on an admittance-controlled robot with joint compliance. Two open-loop control methods are proposed for creating a virtual fixture that prevents the user from entering a forbidden region: one that compensates for hand dynamics, and one that predicts overshoot based on the user's current velocity.

The assistance is usually provided in a virtual fixture framework where the level of compliance can be altered online, thus improving the performance in terms of execution time and overall precision. However, the fixtures are typically inflexible, resulting in a degraded performance in cases of unexpected obstacles or incorrect fixture models. In this paper, we present a method for online task tracking and propose the use of adaptive virtual fixtures that can cope with the above problems. Here, rather than executing a predefined plan, the operator has the ability to avoid unforeseen obstacles and deviate from the model. To allow this, the probability of following a certain trajectory (subtask) is estimated and used to automatically adjusts the compliance, thus providing the online decision of how to fixture the movement. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Human beings cannot control a position of sphere on the disk without seeing it. Because under such a condition, as we determine the position and estimate the motion of sphere by use of visual information, it is very difficult for human beings to control it using only tactile or force information of a hand. This is why the tactile and the force information are less quantitative for human beings than the visual information. On the other hand, a robot can deal with this qualitative information as quantitative values. Therefore, the robot seems to have the possibility that it carries out such difficult tasks for human beings using only force information. In this paper, we propose the estimation method of the position of sphere (made of crystal) on the disk from the force information measured with three - directional force sensors. Then, we tried to examine whether the robot fingers can control the motion of sphere on the disk using only these force information. Actually, the position and the velocity information estimated from force information enable the robot fingers to control the sphere by applying a simple PD control algorithm. Moreover, this paper adds Lyanpunov's stability analysis of the proposed control algorithm. Finally, this results show new robot task which human beings cannot realize, whose demonstration is very interesting. © 2005 IEEE.},

A desired path is obtained using computer vision, and virtual fixtures for assistance in planar path following were implemented on an admittance-controlled robot. The admittance controller uses a velocity gain, so that the speed of the robot is proportional to the force applied by the operator. The level of virtual fixture guidance is determined by the admittance ratio, which is the ratio of the admittance gain of the force components orthogonal to the path to the gain of the force components parallel to the path. In Experiment 1, we found a linear relationship between admittance ratio and performance. In Experiment 2, we examined the effect of admittance ratio on the performance of three tasks: path following, off-path targeting, and obstacle avoidance. An algorithm was developed to select an appropriate admittance ratio based on the nature of the task. Automatic admittance ratio tuning is recommended for next-generation virtual fixtures.

The proposed continuous control strategy achieves semi-global asymptotically stable path following for the robot manipulator in the presence of uncertainty in the robot dynamics. Additionally, the path generator also ensures safety by maintaining the desired net flow of energy during the human robot interaction from the user toward the manipulator. In addition to providing asymptotic path following, the control algorithm also ensures sufficiently rapid error convergence at the end-effector such that the actual energy transfer profile follows the desired energy transfer profile - thus rigorously ensuring user safety.},

	abstract = {We present a method for implementing "steady-hand control" on teleoperators where the master device is of the impedance type. Typical steady-hand systems are admittance controlled cooperative robots that can implement very high damping. Such systems are ideal for implementing guidance virtual fixtures, which are constraints in software that assist a user in moving a tool along preferred paths. Our steady-hand teleoperation method implements a type of admittance control law on an impedance-type master, but requires no force sensor. Combined with guidance virtual fixtures, the system results in a slave device that is precisely constrained to preferred paths. Experimental results demonstrate the desirable behavior of the system. This research is applicable to impedance-type telemanipulation systems, particularly those used in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. © 2003 IEEE.},

The segmentation results are used to provide appropriate assistance in a combined curve following and object avoidance task. This assistance takes the form of a virtual fixture, whose compliance can be altered online. Recognition and assistance experiments were performed using force and position data recorded from a cooperative manipulation system, where a robot and a human operator hold an instrument simultaneously. Recognition accuracy exceeds 90%, even when the users training the HMMs differ from those executing the task. For a task consisting of both path following and avoidance motions, an HMM-based virtual fixture switches the compliance from low to high when the user is trying to move away from the path. The HMM method improves operator performance in comparison with a constant virtual fixture and no virtual fixture. © 2003 IEEE.},

In this paper, we explore in detail one family of constraints: virtual fixtures for use in path following tasks. Vision is used to sense the desired path, and then the robot encourages motion toward and along the path through a direction-based control law. This "soft" virtual fixture allows lows the user to move in other, non-preferred directions, maintaining the user's sense of autonomy and control. Experimental results show that user performance in assisted path following improves with virtual fixture augmentation, and differs with varying fixture compliance.},

The directional coupling in the compliance is shown to be important in establishing multipoint contact (during insertion) and in maintaining contact (while edge tracking) despite finite positional errors.

	abstract = {Impedance control is one of the most effective force control methods for a robot manipulator in contact with an object. It should be noted, however, that a practical study on such a method has not been successfully applied to an industrial robot with 6 degree-of-freedom. Recently, a hybrid compliance/force control (HCC) in this field was suggested to deal with the practical problem, in which a desired damping coefficient is determined by repeating many simulations. To determine a suitable compliance without trial and error, we have already presented a tuning method which produces the desired time-varying compliance, giving the critical damping in contact with an object, by using the information on the inertia and Jacobian matrices. But the tuning method needs to measure the physical information of the environment. In this paper, to overcome the problem we propose a fuzzy environment model that can estimate each directional stiffness of the environments. The fuzzy environment model is composed of several fuzzy rules which are learned with genetic algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed method is very effective for deciding the desired compliance without any complicated tuning and is very robust to the change of environment.},

	abstract = {Dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT) neurons have been shown to transmit signals related to hindlimb position and movement direction in the anesthetized cat. Because both parameters may be encoded by single neurons, we examined the extent in which their representations might occur sequentially or simultaneously by recording unit activity while the hindlimb was moved passively in the sagittal plane by a robot arm. A center-out/out- center paradigm moved the foot 2 cm from a given position radially to eight positions located 45°apart, holding each position for 8 s. Another paradigm moved the foot along various paths to 20 positions distributed throughout most of the limb's workspace. With each paradigm, we could assess the activity related to foot position and the direction of movement to each position. Modulation of unit activity evoked by center-out/out-center movements was determined for each 1-s postmovement interval by use of a cosine tuning model that specified modulation amplitude and preferred direction. Of 125 units tested. 82.4% were significantly modulated (P < 0.05) according to this model. We assessed the relative contributions of position and movement by taking advantage of the fact that directional modulation following out-center movements to a common position could only be related to the movement, whereas that following the center-out movements related to both position and movement. The results suggested a simultaneous modulation by these two parameters. Each cell could be characterized by a similar preferred direction for position or movement modulation and the distribution of preferred directions across cells clustered significantly along an axis close to the limb axis. When the limb axis was rotated, the unit preferred directions rotated similarly, on average. Unexpectedly, we found the activity of more than half the cells to be modulated for ≤8 s after out-center movements, implying a persistent movement-related activity well after a movement is completed. These findings were confirmed and extended with the second paradigm by using a multivariate regression model that included terms for position, movement, and their multiplicative interaction. The activity of 81.3% of the 97 neurons tested fit the model (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.4. P < .0001); 31.6% were modulated exclusively by foot position, and 58.2% simultaneously by both: position and movement, with significant interaction. We conclude from our results that DSCT neurons may be modulated simultaneously by limb position and movement, and their preferred directions tend to align with the limb axis. The modulation is interactive such that movement modulation amplitude depends on limb position, and many cells also retain a memory trace of recent movements. The results are discussed in terms of a possible role for the DSCT in encoding limb compliance.},

	abstract = {An investigation is reported of the design and implementation of a compliant control scheme based on damping control that can be used to perform position and force control of robot manipulators in teleoperation or autonomous control. The dynamic performance of such a system in constrained situations is very dependent on the environmental parameters, e.g., the force response at low stiffness is sluggish, while high stiffness gives rise to bouncing and instability. An adaptive controller based on the model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) approach is developed for a single-axis manipulator model and is further extended to the multiaxis case using the concept of directional adaptation: the MRAC and the compliance are active only in the direction of the force constraints, thus allowing near-perfect velocity and force tracking in all directions. Simulation results show that the adaptive scheme can significantly improve the performance in force tracking and enhance stability at high stiffness by rendering the behavior independent of the environment and robot parameters. Some experimental implementation concerns are presented in light of a series of preliminary tests with a PUMA 560 manipulator.},
