# Thesis Roadmap & Schedule

**Current Strategy:** "Control Mechanics First, Inference Second"

## The "Spine" (Guaranteed Deliverable)
**Focus:** Anisotropic Admittance Control on Unknown Surfaces.
**Goal:** A robot that can "feel" the wall and hold the push-force for you, allowing you to slide it easily sideways, even if the wall is curved.
**Key Technical Challenge:** Estimating the surface normal vector ($n$) and tangent plane in real-time without a CAD model.

## The "Cherry on Top" (High Risk / High Reward)
**Focus:** Active Inference for Intent Detection.
**Goal:** The robot guesses *where* you want to slide before you even push hard.
**Trigger:** Only start this once the "Spine" is working perfectly on hardware/simulation.
